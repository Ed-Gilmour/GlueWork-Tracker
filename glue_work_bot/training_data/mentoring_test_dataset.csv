jackrabbit19,"Hi Alfusainey,

> one change to the json-string: i now encode jcr properties as json objects instead of simple name:value(s) pairs

while I see that using objects for properties is more robust, it defies to purpose of using a simple, human readable format like json. for a machine-to-machine format we can use sysview XML. 

I would really try to use name/value pairs as properties. and encode the type either in the value or in the name (the later has the advantage, that you can define types on jcr mv-properties easier). eg

```
{
""jcr:lastModified@Date"": ""2014-06-10T14:30Z"",
""numbers@Long"": []
}

jackrabbit19,"@Alfusainey while i see the benefit of having less redundant code, i think the additional serialize to xml and then in importXml deserialize again is a severe performance hit. can't you just use the same deserialized objects that represent the information and feed them into the same code?

another thing: to get the acl import working, i would not go about too heavy refactorings of jackrabbit. it will be much more difficult to convince people to accept a severe refactoring with all its potential of bugs or performance penalties over just handling acl nodes with a special handler, with almost no impact on the operations that where already supported.

this decision is up to @anchela and other jackrabbit maintainers but i guess they will be more at ease with less invasive changes. once you got your primary goal through, you can still look at jackrabbit and also oak and see if you want to propose further refactoring. but lets first focus on the primary goal of remoting acl information.

Given we do not have fix which only improves situation (like my PR), we would have to prove.



For this:

0. Check latest Json library and see it returns `object?` - so null is possible. DONE

1. Test with byte array being null, empty. What error we see?

2. Test byte array contains string ""null"", """", ""[]"", ""{}"", not null terminated string, etc.

3. Run generator of byte arrays with https://github.com/haf/expecto#property-based-tests (in C#)



Check that we never ever get null reference in this case. Or in some case we do. Than we should look into Json or into layer creating byte array. And have better semantics for error.

2. There is probably a good reason why a user implements an operator (maybe some outside world communication), so not executing it (for instance no sink attached) will lead to incorrect behaviour. Also we cannot force someone to always use a sink in this case as they might need some special behaviour implemented by some other operator.

flink9867,"My point is that, in my opinion, this configuration (and also [the configuration for the default delimeter](https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/2219#discussion_r70475544)) is not in demand by users.
Instead of exposing this parameter outside of Flink to operators of Flink cluster, you can still make it configurable but internally. So when metrics register themselves, they would define which delimeter to use. End users probably won't need to customize this.

While in case of Prometheus reporter, `.` is [invalid character in metric name](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/data_model/#metric-names-and-labels). InfluxDB reporter just followed this convention (I don't remember exact reason why I didn't use `.`). It may worth to use `_` for all reporters (for unification, as some common ground), but I understand that this would be an incompatible change.

But thinking more generally, I find that the `(CharacterFilter, delimeter)` pair is just a concrete implementation of more generic api (something like `MetricScopeFormatter` that can become more specific (and different) to some metric reporters.

To summarise, my personal cons against this change are:
 * the configuration is not requested by users. Less configuration exposed by Flink - less things to maintain as public api and more freedom to change implementation later;
 * even if the config is exposed, actual correct values that would work in practice are limited (cannot be any character) and specific to actual metrics system;
 * for some reporters, the scope formatting can required to be more flexible (compared to current implementation based on `CharacterFilter` and `delimeter`).",1u0,1604,Y,zentol,

storm1468,"I'm totally +1 to this approach, even though I think script should be modified to Storm's project style.

Like I said to dev@ mailing list, I have been doing reviewing and merging pending pull requests for weeks and months, and it was painful enough to merge and port back to each branches, even though I ignored cleaning up commits. (Pain is amplified when tiny commit should be merged to all branches.) If I want to clean up commits before merging it should be more painful. CHANGELOG is subject to not in sync among branches, but we need to write it manually because it's hard to filter merge commits to see the change list. (We could just rely on JIRA issues for alternative.)

Regarding commits, I don't want to keep commits like 'kicking travis', 'address review comments', etc. which is not helpful at any chances. For my last 2 years of development of Storm, I didn't utilize individual commit. If something is wrong with recent merge, we rollback the merge, not individual commit. Squashing commits is widely used strategy and already shows success story to many big projects. Even Github provides the squash merge mode (recently rebase mode too) in GUI.

If we want to merge in squashed commit, it should be done in merging process, not reviewing process. For me, ideal review process should be contributor-friendly. While we can't put efforts to only maintain Storm project (by reviewing pull requests, etc.), contributors also can't. Once we create a script which also squashes the commits, we don't need to make contributors bothering with rebasing and squashing commits. If not, all individuals including us should do it just after merger said 'please rebase and squash in order to merge.', which is also bothering for mergers, too. Moreover, there's a chance for contributors to be busy at the moment, and pull request goes stale. Pull requests which need upmerging are the case.

I understand and agree the authorship issue, but we can treat it as exceptional case. Many pull requests are authored by one.

Let's make merging phase as painless, or at least less painful thing.

1. I'm not entirely sure I understand the use case. Why do options need to be copied, while other constructs (such as schemas) don't?

2. I disagree for a couple of reasons:
   * A FieldType can be nullable, and there's no reason not to support null FieldTypes in options. By returning null for non-existent fields, you make it hard to distinguish between a null value and an invalid get call (i.e. passing an option that is not part of the schema). This feels like the sort of behavior that seems simpler, but actually makes things more complex (e.g. the fact that Java Maps return null for non-existent values is often considered a mistaken design, for this very reason. It's hard to distinguish between a missing value and an explicit null stored in a map).

   * Options are no different than schemas - there is a static list of options for each field, so I don't see why this is so different.

I also want to understand better why we can't just use Row here (revisiting Brian's question). You mentioned using dots in field names, but AFAIK protobuf also prohibits dots. It's true that dots are often used in option specifications in proto, but that's just to set individual fields of a message. In Beam, we really should model those as a single row-valued option, not as multiple individual options. I.e. (from the proto docs):

    option (my_method_option).foo = 567;
    option (my_method_option).bar = ""Some string"";

should translate to a single Beam option named ""my_method_option"" not to two separate options.

dots are also used to represent package names of course. Is this the main reason you need to support dots?",reuvenlax,82,Y,alexvanboxel,

Thanks a lot for your reply. Regarding adding the `global job configuration`, as it will introduce new API interfaces and it will be better to discuss it in the ML or the mentioned FLIPs.

So how about limiting the scope of this PR to aligning the two planners and discussing the API changes in the FLIP discussion?

cxf746,"Thanks for the PR, @ropalka, I think we got to the point when it is probably make sense to completely separate Jakartaee and Javaee name handler chains (I think you would agree). I suggest to:
1. Introduce `org.apache.cxf.jaxws.handler.jakartaee` and `org.apache.cxf.jaxws.handler.javaee` packages
2. Introduce `JakartaeeHandlerChainBuilder` and `JavaeeHandlerChainBuilder`
3. Basically, I think it safe to assume that either JakartaEE or JavaEE namespace is going to be used, so in this case `AnnotationHandlerChainBuilder` could inspect the namespace, instantiate `JakartaeeHandlerChainBuilder` or`JavaeeHandlerChainBuilder`, and delegate to one of those. In this case, the conditionals should be gone and implementation becomes much cleaner.

",sebgoa,-83 days,N,remibergsma,
beam10413,"Some thoughts:

I know your use case for options involves mapping specific input types to schemas, however we need to make sure that the actual mechanism is more generic than that. We have many uses for field metadata (or options) inside of Beam, completely unrelated to any option concept on input data types. I would not like to make a design choice that precludes nullable FieldTypes now, because we may very well find that we need nullable field types.

That being said: I notice that you haven't removed the FieldType metadata in this PR. Is that planned for a future PR? I don't think we want both metadata and options in the protocol - Options seemed to me to be a better-typed version of metadata.

I don't personally think that the hasOption code is too bad, and it's definitely better than constraining the type system for Options in a way that we quite likely will regret. That being said, you've already added the getValueOrDefault method. So you can still write this code:

   .getFields()
        .forEach(
            f -> {
              Integer pkSequence = f.getOptions().getValueOrDefault(""vptech.data.contract.v1.primary_key"", null);
              if (pkSequence != null) {
                primaryKeyMap.put(pkSequence, dataSchema.indexOf(f.getName()));
              }
            });

A tiny bit more verbose, but much more explicit about what you are trying to do. (FYI the reason I don't suggest allowing getValue to return an Optional<T> - even though it might be the ""better"" solution - is because the rest of the code base does not use Optional, and I want things to stay consistent).

About the removeOption builder method. I'm struggling with this a bit, since it feels like a weird pattern to put remove into a builder. I'm also not sure whether copying a a Schema field with just a subset of options is a common use case or not. Generally we should start off by keeping such things out of the core Beam API until we are convinced that there are multiple users who need them. I think you can still accomplish the same thing by simply adding a new Options.Builder.setOptions override that takes in a Map.

newField = newField.withOptions(Options.builder().setOptions(
     Maps.filterKeys(
        oldField.getOptions().getAllOptions(),
        n -> !n.equals(optionToRemove))));

This code is probably a bit more annoying for you to write. If we are convinced that this is a common use case then I'm ok with adding removeOption, but if it's specific to your use case then I think we're better off adding the new setOptions method and using that.

storm1468,"We may have to modify lots of part of script since...
- We don't have develop branch so all about develop branch should be modified. Spark merge script also doesn't have handling with develop branch since they don't have develop branch, too. Maybe adopting spark script would be easier than adopting kafka script.
- Branch policy is not compatible with projects which uses this script. They have branches per version but we just maintain version lines (major, minor, bugfix) so we should do something while determining fix versions from merged branches.
- We're having master and 1.x / 1.0.x branches heavily diverged, so there're often two or more pull requests submitted per one issue. (Committers don't cherry-pick between master and 1.x for storm-core manually since it's easy to see merge conflict.) It should be tested (at least unit test and integration test) individually, and issue should be closed when all of pull requests are checked in. It means that we're having different merging step which other projects don't have.
- Moreover, commit message hook (closing PR) doesn't work if PR is not against master.
- We should update CHANGELOG while merging step. Personally I don't like updating CHANGELOG so opened thread for discussion but we didn't decide something clearly.
- Commit message will contain body of pull request which is free format for now and tends to be meaningless for commit message. We need to guide contributor to write meaningful information. Thanks for Github we can have [body template of the pull request](https://github.com/blog/2111-issue-and-pull-request-templates) which many projects have been using already.

So without arranging our branch policy and merging step, it will be hard to get merge script fit for us.
