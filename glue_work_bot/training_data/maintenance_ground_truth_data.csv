     our guide to filing a bug first: https://flutter.dev/docs/resources/bug-reports
-->

## Steps to Reproduce

<!-- Please include full steps to reproduce so that we can reproduce the problem. -->

1. Create a new project and add **google_maps_flutter** to it
2. Implement the GoogleMap widget into a new page.
3. Create a new page that will have a button which on click will navigate you to the page with the GoogleMapWidget
4. Click back and you will see what I mean

**Expected results:** <!-- what did you want to see? -->
Google maps to be pushed back and fade out as other UI elements.




**Actual results:** <!-- what did you see? -->
Google maps is pushed back but just disappears

<!--
      Please create a minimal reproducible sample that shows the problem
      and attach it below between the lines with the backticks.

      To create it you can use `flutter create bug` command and update the `main.dart` file.

      Alternatively, you can use https://dartpad.dev/
      which is capable of creating and running small Flutter apps.

      Without this we will unlikely be able to progress on the issue, and because of that
      we regretfully will have to close it.

Tho the bug may be because I use a preview of Flutter 3.7",n,
172073,"Hello everyone, I just upgraded `google_sign_in` from `6.2.2` to `7.1.0` and encountered this error:

`GoogleSignInException(code GoogleSignInExceptionCode.clientConfigurationError, serverClientId must be provided on Android, null`

I managed to fix this issue by providing my web client ID instead of the Android one.

What I don't understand is that in the [integration docs](https://pub.dev/packages/google_sign_in_android#integration), it stated that I don't need `serverClientId` if I already provided `google-services.json`

> If you are not using google-services.json, you need to pass the client ID of the web application you registered as the serverClientId when initialising the GoogleSignIn instance.

Hope anyone can help me understand more about this issue and clear up any misunderstanding on my side.

Thank you.",n,

### Steps to reproduce

Try to write a test that involves e.g. `SharedPreferencesWithCache`

### Expected results

I'd expect the APIs to offer something similar to what the legacy API do, e.g. `SharedPreferences.setMockInitialValues`.
Or, alternatively, a way to set the underlying platform to `.inMemory` (similarly to [this](https://github.com/flutter/packages/blob/1642c3a66759a5388caefc9b5dc38691f3fa5098/packages/shared_preferences/shared_preferences/test/shared_preferences_async_test.dart#L670)).

### Actual results
I tried using the old `.setMockInitialValues` and then opening a `SharedPreferencesWithCache` instance, but this leads to
```
Bad state: The SharedPreferencesAsyncPlatform instance must be set.
```
... as there's no way to access those APIs for me!

### Code sample

<details open><summary>Code sample</summary>

```dart
import ""package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart"";
import ""package:shared_preferences/shared_preferences.dart"";

void main() {
  setUp(() {
    SharedPreferences.setMockInitialValues({});
  });
  test(""let folks mock the new shared prefs apis"", () {
    final prefs = SharedPreferencesWithCache.create(
      cacheOptions: const SharedPreferencesWithCacheOptions(),
    );
    expectLater(prefs, completes);
  });
}
```

<!-- Please tell us exactly how to reproduce the problem you are running into. -->

```
flutter create -t module --org com.example.a library_a
cd library_a
flutter pub add android_intent_plus
flutter build aar

cd ..

flutter create -t module --org com.example.b library_b
cd library_a
flutter pub add android_intent_plus
// Open pubspec.yaml and change android_intent_plus to 1.0.1
flutter build aar --build-number=2.0
```

Add library aars to an android project (I used a new android project)

You can find Gradle scan here https://scans.gradle.com/s/k2kgkmqjntcay

android_intent_plus versions are the same as the root library version. 1.0 and 2.0. 
Library_b overrides the library_a's android_intent_plus dependency because 2.0 is higher than 1.0. But in reality, library_b should have a lower version with 1.0.1 and library_a should have android_intent_plus with version 3.1.5. (or the latest version of android_intent_plus)

Previously reported issue.
https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/115732

Please find flutter projects here. 
[Archive.zip](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/files/10264072/Archive.zip)

- Open the zip, and build projects as described.
- library_a -> flutter build aar --build-number=1.0
- library_b -> flutter build aar --build-number=2.0
- Integrate libraries into a new android project


Build the project. The project will fail with the following error -> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74857653/adding-multiple-flutter-library-modules-fails-build-with-duplicate-class. 

Build with multiple flutter projects should also compile without problem but the build fail is a different case. This issue is intended to manifest the library version issue.

<img width=""590"" alt=""Screenshot 2022-12-20 at 02 51 18"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2559837/208563446-375572e3-c5d1-4c56-aacb-d165b325327b.png"">

As seen in the screenshot, library_a and library_b brings android_intent_plus with their own versions instead of 1.0.1 and 3.1.5.

built aar files' pom have following dependencies.

library_a
```
<dependency>
      <groupId>io.flutter.plugins.androidintent</groupId>
      <artifactId>android_intent_plus</artifactId>
      <version>1.0</version>
      <scope>compile</scope>
    </dependency>
```

library_a
```
<dependency>
      <groupId>io.flutter.plugins.androidintent</groupId>
      <artifactId>android_intent_plus</artifactId>
      <version>2.0</version>
      <scope>compile</scope>
    </dependency>
```

# Expected behaviour

- library_a should request android_intent_plus with 3.1.5
- library_b should request android_intent_plus with 1.0.1

when they added to a grade build.",n,
136029,"### Steps to reproduce

Create a gesture detector and add a callback on ScaleUpdate to inspect the focal point of the scale gesture and the number of pointer that it has.
```
 GestureDetector(
      onScaleUpdate: (d) {
        print(""Focal Point: ${d.focalPoint} Scale: ${d.scale}, Pointer Count: ${d.pointerCount}"");
      },
      child: Container(
        color: Colors.red,
        child: Center(),
      ),
   );
```

Then try to pinch and zoom first with a trackpad and then with a touch device.

### Expected results

When Using The Touch device, the `focalPoint` stays correctly around the center of the gesture (give or take a take a few pixel due to human error) and the `pointerCount` is 2 as expected.

### Actual results

When performing the same gesture on the trackpad (I am using the same device,  a windows laptop with a touch screen), the focal point changes a lot (it appears to coincide with the location of one pointer) and the pointerCount is 1 despite using two fingers to perform the action.

### Problem:

Since the latest Flutter versions, users have reported that animations are super fast. We found that this issue is connected to the developer setting on Android: ""Transition animation scale"". If this setting is set to ""OFF,"" Flutter animations happen instantly, which completely destroys the user experience.
Of course, not everyone has Developer Settings enabled, but regardless, please treat ""Transition animation scale - OFF"" the same way as in previous versions, where it was not a problem. Simply set it to Animation Scale x1 for example. 

### Expected results

Normal animation speed

### Actual results

Animations are instand

### Code sample

```
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      debugShowCheckedModeBanner: false,
      home: AnimationScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class AnimationScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _AnimationScreenState createState() => _AnimationScreenState();
}

class _AnimationScreenState extends State<AnimationScreen> {
  bool _isExpanded = true;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text(""Flutter Tween Animation"")),
      body: Center(
        child: TweenAnimationBuilder<double>(
          duration: Duration(seconds: 1),
          tween: Tween<double>(
            begin: _isExpanded ? 0.5 : 1.5,
            end: _isExpanded ? 1.5 : 0.5,
          ),
          onEnd: () {
            setState(() {

          builder: (context, scale, child) {

85203,"I'm attempting to upgrade the `in_app_purchase` from 0.5.x to 1.0.x but it seems that the purchase restoration user flow that we are currently using on iOS is no longer achievable with the newer version of the plugin. I'd appreciate guidance on how to achieve our current functionality with `in_app_purchase` 1.0 or (alternatively) what is the recommended user experience for purchase restoration on iOS that is compatible with `in_app_purchase` 1.0.

Currently, our application works like this:
1. User taps ""restore purchases"" and the application starts showing a progress indicator.
2. Behind the scenses, `InAppPurchase.instance.queryPastPurchases()` is called.
3. When the call finishes, the progress indicator is hidden, and the return value is inspected.
4. If current purchases were returned: they are restored.
5. **If no current purchases were returned: a message is shown letting the user know that there was nothing to restore and suggesting making a new purchase.**

Now `queryPastPurchases()` has been removed. `restorePurchases()` can be used instead, but it doesn't return anything. So it seems the app won't be able to react when there was nothing to restore. The user won't get any feedback after tapping the button, which doesn't seem user-friendly at all. From the user's standpoint, it looks like that app just ignores the taps (because nothing happens), so it looks like the app is broken.

I'd like at least **one** of the following:
1. A way to know that nothing was restored by `restorePurchases()`
2. A way to know that there is nothing to restore, even before calling `restorePurchases()`
3. A recommendation for a different purchase restoration user experience on iOS that is at lest as user-friendly as our current one and compatible with `in_app_purchase` 1.0.",n,
173616,"### Steps to reproduce

Not sure if this is Windows specific.

- Create or `cd` to a sample Flutter project
- Run `flutter widget-preview start --web-server`
- Wait for ""Done loading previews"" to appear
- Press Ctrl+C to terminate the process
- Repeat some number of times

Here's a PowerShell script that does this in a loop 10 times:

```
for ($i = 1; $i -le 10; $i++) {
    $tempLog = Join-Path -Path $env:TEMP -ChildPath ""flut_$i.txt""
    # Removed RedirectStandardError and the delay between processes
    $p = Start-Process -FilePath ""flutter"" -ArgumentList ""widget-preview"", ""start"", ""--web-server"" -PassThru -NoNewWindow -RedirectStandardOutput $tempLog
    $start = Get-Date
    while (-not ((Get-Content $tempLog -Raw -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue) -match ""Done loading previews"") -and ((Get-Date) - $start).TotalSeconds -lt 300) {
        Start-Sleep -Milliseconds 500
    }
    Stop-Process -Id $p.Id -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

I'm trying to login with youtube channels (not just the Google account itself.) 

on the console, I've added auth/youtube to the OAuth screen (not sure if this is needed)


I've also added this to my scopes 

`GoogleSignIn googleSignIn = GoogleSignIn(

When I try to log in it shows me my e-mails and when selected it gives me a screen if I want to accept ""project......"" (not sure how to change this to the name app btw) to manage my youtube channels and whatnot. however when I press yes, it doesn't show me the channel list so I can select the one I want. So I don't really have access to the user channel stuff like playlists, name, memberships and subscriptions, image, etc... how could I fix this?

Here are the screens I DO get

174378,"### Use case

```dart
  /// The offset of the menu relative to the alignment origin determined by
  /// [MenuStyle.alignment] on the [style] attribute and the ambient
  /// [Directionality].
```
Currently `MenuAnchor`  uses the ambient `Directionality` to decide if the menu should align to the left or to the right. For example you need rtl direction for effect like this
<img width=""151"" height=""205"" alt=""Image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e4802c6f-3d5e-4cc1-8bb1-d9399776d9fb"" />

There is no way to specify a direction for the `MenuAnchor`.  You can provide `Directionality` in the tree, but it is unintuitive and you also need to switch back the directionality for each children.

```dart
class MyWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyWidget({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Center(
      child: Directionality(
        textDirection: TextDirection.rtl,
        child: MenuAnchor(
          style: MenuStyle(alignment: Alignment.bottomRight),
          menuChildren: [
            Directionality(
              textDirection: TextDirection.ltr,
              child: ListTile(
                title: Text(""Item 1""),
              ),
            ),
            Directionality(
              textDirection: TextDirection.ltr,
              child: ListTile(
                title: Text(""Item 2""),
              ),
            ),
          ],
          builder: (context, controller, child) {
            return IconButton(
              onPressed: controller.open,
              icon: Icon(Icons.add),
            );
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}


```

### Proposal

Add an direction option for `MenuAnchor`
```dart
class MyWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyWidget({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MenuAnchor(
      style: MenuStyle(alignment: AlignmentGeometry.bottomRight),
      direction: TextDirection.rtl,
      menuChildren: [
        ListTile(
          title: Text(""Item 1""),
        ),
        ListTile(
          title: Text(""Item 2""),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}
```
I can work on a PR if the team think it is OK to add this new option.",n,
168641,"### Steps to reproduce

Very often, it is not possible to inspect variable values by hovering over variable names while in a Flutter web debug session. The actual variable value is not displayed as it would be expected. Instead, a tooltip displaying the type of the variable is displayed, just as if the debugger wasn't running.

1. Create a Flutter web application using flutter create, then add an `async` function somewhere. Call it from, eg., the `incrementCounter()` implementation. Just print something out in this async function.
2. Place a breakpoint on the `print` line and start debugging
3. When you reach your breakpoint, try hovering a member variable name in the source code.




### Expected results

The variable value should be displayed.

### Actual results

The value of the variable is not displayed.

When the problem occurs, if you type the variable name in the debug console, you will see:

```
> image
CompilationError: The getter 'image' isn't defined for the class 'XXXPageState'.
 - 'XXXPageState' is from 'package:com_example_application/xxx_page.dart' ('lib/xxx_page.dart').
Try correcting the name to the name of an existing getter, or defining a getter or field named 'image'.
image
^^^^^
```

The debug console (itself) seems to work overall though:

```
> print(1234)
1234
> this
XXXPageState (XXXPageState#e5b8d)
  ... (correct output here)
```

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e2bb20e5-79e0-4c5b-8e78-3ef8bde68272)

In the code above, note that image does have a value - and that value should be displayed - as the line of code above the yellow indicator has (successfully) been executed.

Also, the image variable is effectively used in the code further below (not shown), and even print'ed. It is not expected to be tree-shaken.

Occasionnally, the VS console log shows:

This PR improves the StretchingOverscrollIndicator to better match native Android behavior.

- Previously, the stretch effect worked well only for slow dragging, and during fast flings it was absent or felt clipped.
- Implemented a Simulation-based animation that responds naturally to both slow drags and high-velocity flings.
- The result closely resembles the native Android overscroll behavior while maintaining Flutter's performance characteristics.

This change ensures that momentum-based gestures produce a more natural and intuitive overscroll experience, especially for users accustomed to native Android scroll views.

This PR adds bundling support for the experimental dart data asset feature: Dart packages with hooks can now emit data assets which the flutter tool will bundle.

It relies on flutter's existing asset bundling mechanism (e.g. entries in AssetManifest.json, DevFS syncing in reload/restart, ...).

The support is added under an experimental flag (similar to the existing native assets experimental flag).

Also, kNativeAssets is removed to also bundle data assets on flutter build bundle.

The chrome sandbox is disabled as per #165664.

### Steps to reproduce

Used https://github.com/MohanedZekry/flutter-go-router-example to reproduce:

1. Replace home_screen.dart:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  const HomeScreen({Key? key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Center(
      child: PopupMenuButton<String>(
        icon: const Icon(Icons.menu, color: Colors.white),
        elevation: 16.0,
        shape: const RoundedRectangleBorder(
          borderRadius: BorderRadius.all(Radius.circular(4.0)),
        ),
        position: PopupMenuPosition.under,
        offset: const Offset(0, 16),
        itemBuilder: (BuildContext context) {
          return [
            const PopupMenuItem<String>(
              value: 'item1',
              child: Text('Item 1'),
            ),
          ];
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

2. Open PopUpMenu
3. Navigate to any BottomMenuItem (other than HOME)

### Expected results

When navigating to another tab, the popup should automatically close.

### Actual results

The popup does not close and remains visible.

### Steps to reproduce

Used https://github.com/MohanedZekry/flutter-go-router-example to reproduce:

1. Replace `home_screen.dart`:
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  const HomeScreen({Key? key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Center(
      child: PopupMenuButton<String>(
        icon: const Icon(Icons.menu, color: Colors.white),
        elevation: 16.0,
        shape: const RoundedRectangleBorder(
          borderRadius: BorderRadius.all(Radius.circular(4.0)),
        ),
        position: PopupMenuPosition.under,
        offset: const Offset(0, 16),
        itemBuilder: (BuildContext context) {
          return [
            const PopupMenuItem<String>(
              value: 'item1',
              child: Text('Item 1'),
            ),
          ];
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}
```
2. Open PopUpMenu
3. Navigate to any BottomMenuItem (other than HOME)

### Expected results

Pop up should dismiss without error
Go_Router navigation should own the WidgetTree and navigate

### Actual results

App shows red screen with following error, Go_Router navigation occurs beneath:

`════════ Exception caught by widgets library ═══════════════════════════════════
The following assertion was thrown building LayoutBuilder:
This widget has been unmounted, so the State no longer has a context (and should be considered defunct).
Consider canceling any active work during ""dispose"" or using the ""mounted"" getter to determine if the State is still active.`

### Steps to reproduce

`CupertinoTextFormFieldRow` with a non-null `placeholder` parameter causes the dialog content to become scrollable in `CupertinoAlertDialog`, even when there's sufficient space to display all content without scrolling.

STR: 

1. Create a CupertinoAlertDialog with a CupertinoTextFormFieldRow that has a non-null `placeholder`
2. Observe that the dialog content becomes scrollable
3. Remove the placeholder parameter (set to null)
4. Observe that the dialog no longer scrolls

### Expected results

The content is not scrollable and the placeholder is rendered correctly.

### Actual results

The dialog content is scrollable in spite there's more than enough space

171379,"Refiling of #169273, which itself is a rebase of #159675

This PR adds bundling support for the experimental dart data asset feature: Dart packages with hooks can now emit data assets which the flutter tool will bundle.

It relies on flutter's existing asset bundling mechanism (e.g. entries in AssetManifest.json, DevFS syncing in reload/restart, ...).

The support is added under an experimental flag (similar to the existing native assets experimental flag).

Also, kNativeAssets is removed to also bundle data assets on flutter build bundle.

The chrome sandbox is disabled as per #165664.

```
",n,
174783,"### Steps to reproduce

When I use a normal `GestureDetector` I get my terminal filled with warnings on the motion event, such as this:

```
W/MotionEvent-JNI(11414): android_view_MotionEvent_nativeGetPointerCount: -1
```


### Expected results

I expect the touch events of the `GestureDetector` to not trigger any warning

### Actual results

I get spammed with the following warning whenever I touch the `GestureDetector`:
```
W/MotionEvent-JNI(11414): android_view_MotionEvent_nativeGetPointerCount: -1
```

### Code sample

<details open><summary>Code sample</summary>

The code needed to reproduce this error is a simple `StatefulWidget` with a single `GestureDetector` button:
```dart
class TestGraphics extends StatefulWidget {
  const TestGraphics({super.key});

  @override
  State<TestGraphics> createState() => _TestGraphicsState();
}

class _TestGraphicsState extends State<TestGraphics> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      body: Column(
        mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
        children: [
          GestureDetector(
            onTap: () {
              print(""TEST"");
            },
            child: Container(color: Colors.amber, width: 100, height: 100),
          ),
         ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

174770,"### What package does this bug report belong to?

integration_test

### What target platforms are you seeing this bug on?

Web

### Have you already upgraded your packages?

Yes

### Dependency versions

I am trying to run the _extended_test_web.dart with the extended_integration_test.dart driver (https://github.com/flutter/flutter/tree/master/packages/integration_test/example)
 using the takeScreenshot method after upgrading Flutter and setting up chromedriver.





### Steps to reproduce

1. Upgrade Flutter to the latest version.

2. Install and run chromedriver:

3. Run: 
 ```chromedriver --port=4444```

4. Run the integration test with Flutter Drive:

```
flutter drive \
 --driver=test_driver/extended_integration_test.dart \ 
 --target=integration_test/extended_test.dart \    
 -d web-server
```

(also tried with -d chrome)

### Expected results

The test should run successfully and takeScreenshot should capture a screenshot.


### Actual results

A new Chrome window opens, but the test hangs before reaching the takeScreenshot step. The screenshot is never taken.

### Code sample


```

void main() {
  final IntegrationTestWidgetsFlutterBinding binding =
      IntegrationTestWidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();

  testWidgets('verify text', (WidgetTester tester) async {
    app.main();

    await tester.pumpAndSettle();

    // Take a screenshot.
    await binding.takeScreenshot(
      'platform_name',
      <String, Object?>{'someArgumentKey': 'someArgumentValue'},
    );

    expect(
      find.byWidgetPredicate(
        (Widget widget) =>
            widget is Text &&
            widget.data!.startsWith('Platform: ${web.window.navigator.platform}\n'),
      ),
      findsOneWidget,
    );
  });

```

test_driver/integration_test.dart:

```
import 'package:flutter_driver/flutter_driver.dart';
import 'package:integration_test/integration_test_driver_extended.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  final FlutterDriver driver = await FlutterDriver.connect();
  await integrationDriver(
    driver: driver,
    onScreenshot:
        (String screenshotName, List<int> screenshotBytes, [Map<String, Object?>? args]) async {
          if (args != null) {
            final String? someArgumentValue = args['someArgumentKey'] as String?;
            return someArgumentValue != null;
          }

We switched our app to compile dart to wasm for higher performance which is experimental.
For my colleagues it works fine. Also in same browser than mine. 
But for me I get this (see expected Results and Actual results):
The weird thing is, it's random on which images it happens, some images sometimes show, sometimes the images in the Carousel on top are also not visible. It says this which makes no sense at all since some images show and some not and they are all webp. Yes I tested to not use default and still the same.
Error message: see logs below

My Flutter version is 3.27.4, and my iOS app, developed purely for Flutter, has been in the background for extended periods of time, perhaps several hours, and then hot-started back to the foreground.

### Expected results

I was hoping everything would work fine.

### Actual results

However, most images loaded from Boundary appear white. My Flutter version is 3.27.4, and after upgrading to 3.32.6, the images turn purple. This issue persists. I also found output code in the Flutter source code. Is there a solution? How have other pure Flutter apps resolved this issue? The app has requested background operation.

174776,"## Problem

Since Flutter 3.35, `MediaQuery.of(context)` inside CupertinoNavigationBar components (trailing, leading, middle, etc.) returns `Size(0.0, 0.0)` instead of the correct screen dimensions. This regression breaks responsive logic and layout decisions made within navigation bar components.

## Root Cause

The issue occurs because CupertinoNavigationBar components wrap their child widgets with `MediaQuery` widgets that only provide `textScaler` data using `MediaQueryData(textScaler: ...)`. When creating a `MediaQueryData` with only specific properties, all other properties default to their initial values, causing `size` to default to `Size.zero`.

Affected components:
- Leading widget
- Trailing widget 
- Middle widget
- Back chevron
- Back label
- Large title
- Bottom widget

## Solution

Replace `MediaQueryData()` constructors with `MediaQuery.of(context).copyWith()` to preserve all existing MediaQuery properties (size, padding, devicePixelRatio, etc.) while only modifying the text scaling behavior.

## Changes

### Core Fix
- Modified 6 `MediaQueryData` constructor calls in `packages/flutter/lib/src/cupertino/nav_bar.dart`
- Preserves all inherited MediaQuery properties while maintaining text scaling limits
- Ensures `size`, `padding`, `devicePixelRatio` and other properties are not reset to defaults

### Testing
- Added comprehensive test suite with 3 focused test cases in `packages/flutter/test/cupertino/nav_bar_test.dart`
- Tests verify MediaQuery size preservation in trailing/leading widgets
- Regression test specifically prevents Size(0,0) from returning
- Tests are minimal and focused on the core issue

## Impact

### Fixed Issues
- ✅ MediaQuery.of(context).size returns correct screen dimensions
- ✅ MediaQuery.of(context).padding returns correct safe area padding  
- ✅ MediaQuery.of(context).devicePixelRatio returns correct pixel ratio
- ✅ Responsive navigation bar components work correctly
- ✅ No impact on existing text scaling behavior

### Compatibility
- ✅ Backward compatible - no breaking changes
- ✅ No impact on Material design widgets
- ✅ All existing CupertinoNavigationBar functionality preserved
- ✅ Performance neutral - same number of MediaQuery widgets

## Testing Instructions

To verify the fix:

```dart
CupertinoNavigationBar(
  trailing: Builder(
    builder: (context) {
      final size = MediaQuery.of(context).size;
      print('Size: $size'); // Should print actual screen size, not Size(0.0, 0.0)
      return Icon(CupertinoIcons.info);
    },
  ),
)
```

141239,"### Use case

We use local_auth plugin which used androidx Biometric on Android.

androidx biometric force use fragment Activity, so we change our super class to FlutterFragmentActivity.

Previously, we override `getCachedEngineId` to used cached fragment, but this result in blank screen after put app in background for over one night.

Then we  remove `getCachedEngineId`, and use override of `provideFlutterEngine`.

Recently, when using monkey test on Android, we found crash log for flutter fragment like this:

```console

```

### Proposal

I checked the start process of FlutterFragmentActivity and found this:

method `ensureFlutterFragmentCreated` in FlutterFragmentActivity will call `createFlutterFragment`,
when `getCachedEngineId() != null` it will use `CachedEngineFragmentBuilder` to build the Fragment, which provide `destroyEngineWithFragment` method to hook the engine.

But when using  provideFlutterEngine, It will use NewEngineFragmentBuilder, which config `ARG_DESTROY_ENGINE_WITH_FRAGMENT` to true in `createArgs`.
```java
    @NonNull
    protected Bundle createArgs() {
      Bundle args = new Bundle();
      args.putString(ARG_CACHED_ENGINE_GROUP_ID, cachedEngineGroupId);
      args.putString(ARG_DART_ENTRYPOINT, dartEntrypoint);
      args.putString(ARG_INITIAL_ROUTE, initialRoute);
      args.putBoolean(ARG_HANDLE_DEEPLINKING, handleDeeplinking);
      args.putString(
          ARG_FLUTTERVIEW_RENDER_MODE,
          renderMode != null ? renderMode.name() : RenderMode.surface.name());
      args.putString(
          ARG_FLUTTERVIEW_TRANSPARENCY_MODE,
          transparencyMode != null ? transparencyMode.name() : TransparencyMode.transparent.name());
      args.putBoolean(ARG_SHOULD_ATTACH_ENGINE_TO_ACTIVITY, shouldAttachEngineToActivity);
      args.putBoolean(ARG_DESTROY_ENGINE_WITH_FRAGMENT, true);
      args.putBoolean(
          ARG_SHOULD_AUTOMATICALLY_HANDLE_ON_BACK_PRESSED, shouldAutomaticallyHandleOnBackPressed);
      args.putBoolean(ARG_SHOULD_DELAY_FIRST_ANDROID_VIEW_DRAW, shouldDelayFirstAndroidViewDraw);
      return args;
    }
```

The same issue with NewEngineInGroupFragmentBuilder.

In FlutterFragment `shouldDestroyEngineWithHost` method, it deal with the cached case and provided case in same process.
```java
  @Override
  public boolean shouldDestroyEngineWithHost() {
    boolean explicitDestructionRequested =
        getArguments().getBoolean(ARG_DESTROY_ENGINE_WITH_FRAGMENT, false);//Since NewEngineInGroupFragmentBuilder always put true, we got true here.
    if (getCachedEngineId() != null || delegate.isFlutterEngineFromHost()) {
      // Only destroy a cached engine if explicitly requested by app developer.
      return explicitDestructionRequested;
    } else {
      // If this Fragment created the FlutterEngine, destroy it by default unless
      // explicitly requested not to.
      return getArguments().getBoolean(ARG_DESTROY_ENGINE_WITH_FRAGMENT, true);
    }
  }
```
But because NewEngineFragmentBuilder not respect to what we configured in FlutterFragmentActivity with `shouldDestroyEngineWithHost` method, we got this issue.

I think we should respect cached engine and provided engine in both creation of fragment and `detachFromFlutterEngine` in 
`FlutterActivityAndFragmentDelegate`

## Code sample

<details><summary>Code sample for recordings</summary>

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(const DropdownMenuExample());
}

class DropdownMenuExample extends StatefulWidget {
  const DropdownMenuExample({super.key});

  @override
  State<DropdownMenuExample> createState() => _DropdownMenuExampleState();
}

        body: DropdownMenu<int>(
          expandedInsets: EdgeInsets.zero,
          dropdownMenuEntries: <DropdownMenuEntry<int>>[
            DropdownMenuEntry<int>(value: 0, label: 'Flutter'),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}


``` 
</details> 

## Implementation details

MenuAnchor automatically adds a default padding, see https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/2c21273bfde5da921df512034f30ff7fd042db97/packages/flutter/lib/src/material/menu_anchor.dart#L81-L82

This PR add a property to menu anchor to expose the view padding.
DropdownMenu sets this padding to EdgeInsets.zero to opt-out from the default 8 padding.

174777,This is my attempt to handle https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/6537 for the DropdownMenuFormField widget.,y,
174775,"## Problem

Since Flutter 3.35, `MediaQuery.of(context)` inside CupertinoNavigationBar components (trailing, leading, middle, etc.) returns `Size(0.0, 0.0)` instead of the correct screen dimensions. This regression breaks responsive logic and layout decisions made within navigation bar components.

## Root Cause

The issue was introduced when CupertinoNavigationBar components started wrapping their child widgets with `MediaQuery` widgets that only provided `textScaler` data using `MediaQueryData(textScaler: ...)`. When creating a `MediaQueryData` with only specific properties, all other properties default to their initial values, causing `size` to default to `Size.zero`.

Affected components:
- Leading widget
- Trailing widget 
- Middle widget
- Back chevron
- Back label
- Large title
- Bottom widget

## Solution

Replace `MediaQueryData()` constructors with `MediaQuery.of(context).copyWith()` to preserve all existing MediaQuery properties (size, padding, devicePixelRatio, etc.) while only modifying the text scaling behavior.

## Changes

### Core Fix
- Modified 6 `MediaQueryData` constructor calls in `packages/flutter/lib/src/cupertino/nav_bar.dart`
- Preserves all inherited MediaQuery properties while maintaining text scaling limits
- Ensures `size`, `padding`, `devicePixelRatio` and other properties are not reset to defaults

### Testing
- Added comprehensive test suite with 6 new test cases in `packages/flutter/test/cupertino/nav_bar_test.dart`
- Tests cover MediaQuery size preservation in trailing/leading widgets
- Tests verify MediaQuery padding and devicePixelRatio preservation  
- Tests validate middle widget and large title MediaQuery preservation
- Regression test specifically checking for Size(0,0) prevention
- All existing tests continue to pass (76/76 passing)

## Impact

### Fixed Issues
- ✅ MediaQuery.of(context).size returns correct screen dimensions
- ✅ MediaQuery.of(context).padding returns correct safe area padding
- ✅ MediaQuery.of(context).devicePixelRatio returns correct pixel ratio
- ✅ Responsive navigation bar components work correctly
- ✅ No impact on existing text scaling behavior

### Compatibility
- ✅ Backward compatible - no breaking changes
- ✅ No impact on Material design widgets
- ✅ All existing CupertinoNavigationBar functionality preserved
- ✅ Performance neutral - same number of MediaQuery widgets

## Testing Instructions

To verify the fix:

1. Create a CupertinoNavigationBar with trailing/leading widgets
2. Access MediaQuery.of(context).size inside the widget builders
3. Verify size returns actual screen dimensions, not Size(0,0)

```dart
CupertinoNavigationBar(
  trailing: Builder(
    builder: (context) {
      final size = MediaQuery.of(context).size;
      print('Size: $size'); // Should print actual screen size, not Size(0.0, 0.0)
      return Icon(CupertinoIcons.info);
    },
  ),
)
```

</p>

The issue occurs when a reorder animation is interrupted by starting a new drag operation. The interrupted animation would reset to the starting position of the original animation rather than capturing the current animated position, causing a visual jump.

## Solution

This PR fixes the issue by:
1. Storing the previous target offset before updating to a new target
2. When an animation is interrupted, calculating the actual current position based on the animation's progress
3. Using this calculated position as the new starting point for the next animation

- #172740
- #172380
- #172739
- #172738

Fixes #173243

## Code Changes

```dart
// Before
_startOffset = offset;

// After  
final double currentAnimValue = Curves.easeInOut.transform(_offsetAnimation\!.value);
final Offset currentPosition = Offset.lerp(_startOffset, previousTarget, currentAnimValue)\!;
_startOffset = currentPosition;
```

This ensures smooth transitions without visual jumping, making rapid reordering gestures feel more responsive and natural.

171334,"### Description

This PR enhances the CupertinoDatePicker by introducing a weekType parameter, giving developers more control over which days users can select.

### Solution

To address this, I've added a new weekType parameter to the CupertinoDatePicker widget. This parameter offers a declarative way to control the set of selectable days displayed in the picker, with options defined in a new WeekType enum:

WeekType.workDays (Monday-Friday)

WeekType.weekends (Saturday-Sunday)

WeekType.fullWeek (all days, current default behavior)

WeekType.custom (allows developers to provide a List<int> representing the DateTime.weekday values that should be visible and selectable).

### Example
```dart
// Example: Display only work days (Monday-Friday)
CupertinoDatePicker(
  mode: CupertinoDatePickerMode.date,
  initialDateTime: DateTime.now(),
  minimumDate: DateTime(2023, 1, 1),
  maximumDate: DateTime(2024, 12, 31),
  weekType: WeekType.workDays,
  onDateTimeChanged: (DateTime newDateTime) {
    // Handle date change
  },
);
```

174374,"Updating AccessibilityBridge.java and AccessibilityBridgeTest.java to include `AccessibilityNodeInfo.CollectionItemInfo` to get TalkBack to announce item indexes for ListViews. 

- Updated the logic for adding CollectionInfo to add when the scrollChildren count is greater than 1. This is an attempt to exclude something like a SingleChildScrollView from getting CollectionInfo added. The only semantics info we can rely on from Android is the hasImplicitScrolling and the number of scrollChildren. 
- Added logic for adding the CollectionItemInfo to ListView children. It first checks to see if the parent node qualifies for CollectionInfo and then adds the CollectionItemInfo to the child view. The index values come from the `childrenInTraversalOrder`. We aren't currently passing the indexedSemantics into the SemanticsNode. Once those values are available, this can be made more robust. 

The following video includes the new changes with a ListView

This video includes the logic with a SingleChildScrollView (no list announcements as expected)

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8fe4dd24-cc5a-4a6b-b4b0-0f371fea20df

Fixes #168651 - This is a minimal fix. A full fix would be to pass the indexedSemantics to the SemanticsNode in Android and build the list with those values.

The `.separated` constructor allows developers to define custom separators between the list items without the need to manually modify their list or create custom widgets. This API enhancement improves the overall usability and flexibility of `ReorderableListView`.

### Key Changes:

- Added a new `.separated` constructor to `ReorderableListView`.
- Included appropriate documentation for the new constructor with usage examples.
- Updated the relevant tests to verify the behavior of `.separated` functionality.
- Ensured backward compatibility for existing constructors.

This new feature addresses the requests in issue [#76706](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/76706).

174466,"This change allows for the widget previewer to react to `activeLocationChanged` events sent over the `Editor` DTD service to automatically filter the set of visible previews based on the currently selected file in the IDE. This functionality can be turned on or off depending on whether or not the developer wants to see all previews in the project at once.

This change also includes some minor refactoring and UI changes to move the widget preview environment controls to a reserved area at the bottom of the preview window.

This PR is not a result of a thorough fix for mouse cursors on all platforms, but simply matching the behavior of `SelectionArea` on Web to that on non-Web.

A central question lies how a platform view widget should control the mouse cursor. On the surface, the answer is simple: it doesn't, and let the view content to control (hence the `MouseCursor.uncontrolled` constant). But what if the empty region of the view content doesn't control the cursor at all? This would be a problem even on non-Web, because if neither the view content nor the view controls the cursor on non-Web, then the user will find the cursor remaining the one used by the last region, which would be different when entering and when leaving, the same bug as  https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/174246 . On the other hand, what is it supposed to fall back to if the view content doesn't define a cursor? Is the default cursor the logically correct option? ...

I decided that I did not want to dig too much into the details, and instead focus on this specific issue. I tried the repro app on macOS and found that the empty region of `SelectionArea` falls back to the widget behind it, the same behavior as `MouseCursor.defer`. Therefore in this PR I made `MouseCursor.uncontrolled` essentially the same as `.defer` on Web, matching the behavior across platforms.

#### Description
In this PR:
    - Address the issue reported where the value indicator shape does not fully surround the label when multiline text is set. The fix is applied for both cases when `year2023` flag is true or false (corresponding to `DropSliderValueIndicatorShape` or `RoundedRectSliderValueIndicatorShape`).
    - Add some tests.
    - Enable support for an optional configuration of multiline label for the slider value indicator: introduce `ValueIndicatorMultilineConfig` in `SliderThemeData` with 3 properties: `enabled`, `maxLines`, and `cornerPadding`.

This PR refactored the grafting part on `OverlayPortal`. Originally, the semantics tree of `OverlayPortal` was constructed/grafted in render object phase to make sure the correctness of the traversal order. However this resulted wrong hit-test order and the issue surfaced on web. With the fact that on web we are not able to graft/correct hit-test order tree, this PR:
* Reverts the original grafting of the `OverlayPortal` so the hit-test order is always correct. 
* Then, we adds the grafting and updates the traversal order when we send `childrenInTraversalOrder` to engine.
* Updating `childrenInTraversalOrder` causes it have different length from the length of `childrenInHitTestOrder` and wrong hit-test transform of the `OverlayPortal` children because when the transform is calculated, it assumes a correct traversal order. To fix these issues, this PR also:
  * recalculates the transform for `OverlayPortal` children.
  * adds `hitTestTransform` property and pass it to Android engine.
  * skip grafting for web because it assumes the same length of `childrenInTraversalOrder` and `childrenInHitTestOrder`.
  * added grafting by using `ARIA-owns` in web engine to fix the traversal order.

Fixes production crashes in `RenderSliverFixedExtentBoxAdaptor` caused by `NaN` or `Infinity` values being passed to `.round()` and `.floor()` operations.

## Changes

- Added finite value validation in `getMinChildIndexForScrollOffset()` and `getMaxChildIndexForScrollOffset()` 
- Added comprehensive tests for `NaN` and `Infinity` edge cases
- Returns safe default value (0) when non-finite values are encountered

## Test Plan

- [x] All existing tests pass (26/26)
- [x] New edge case tests pass (10/10) covering:
  - NaN scroll offset
  - Infinite scroll offset (positive and negative)  
  - NaN item extent
  - Infinite item extent
- [x] Code analysis shows no issues

## Breaking Change

No breaking changes. This fix maintains existing behavior for all valid inputs while preventing crashes on invalid inputs.
