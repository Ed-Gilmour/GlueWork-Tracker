In our [recent effort](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/169365/files#diff-015f3e087548346bf894f919ba75a880b18a574235080bf1f921bb232c07ba34R23) to support SceneDelegate, we still keep plugin registration in app delegate, via `FlutterPluginRegistrant` protocol. 

Developers put the logic inside AppDelegate: 

```
class AppDelegate: FlutterPluginRegistrant {
  func register(with registry: FlutterPluginRegistry) {
    ...
  }
}
```



### Proposal

There has been hints that AppDelegate is going away. We should instead leverage SceneDelegate to take over this responsibility.

174456,"Skwams currently rasters images at their `cullRect` size, and resizes the `bitmaprenderer` canvas that will display the bitmap to the `cullRect` size. It is unclear if the speed-up from the smaller bitmap creation outweighs the cost of resizing and recreating the `bitmaprenderer` canvas.

To prepare for the web renderer unification and unify the rasterization step between the two renderers, this change makes it so Skwasm rasters the pictures at the full screen size, and no longer needs to resize the `bitmaprenderer` canvases unless the screen size changes.

2. Run the app on the latest master (tested on iOS (both simulator and& physical devices), as well as macOS)
3. Navigate to any of the wonders 
4. Find and click a collectible on the wonders page
5. After clicking the collectible, click on the `View in my collection` button to navigate to the collection page


### Expected results

No error is thrown from the framework.

### Actual results

The error below is thrown by the framework

Bisected this to https://github.com/flutter/flutter/commit/d3e8dc3df9e81778c6d8db44d0dd095249fbf0d9. 
cc @LongCatIsLooong, It seems like the fix for https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/168936 might have broke something else. Full logs in the log section below

This works as expected on the stable & beta channels

Master 3.33.0-1.0.pre.377 is the last master version where it works as expected. 

### Code sample

Use the wonderous app https://github.com/gskinnerTeam/flutter-wonderous-app.git

",,
158918,"DRAFT of trying to solve assertion issues on painting Ink in a stacked route (via Overlay).

Note: The `Offstage` widget actually layouts the widgets, even if they are not shown. So other widgets can interact with it and know its size. On the other hand, the Overlay widget ignores them during layout, but still has them in the widget tree.
So the question is, should `Overlay` behave the same as `Offstage` ? If not, then painting should be forbidden for `Renderboxes` which haven't laid out (have no size) to ensure, e.g. `Ink` is not throwing an error.

Contributes to #147452 and 
Closes #151536

174398,"## Problem
Flutter forwards application lifecycle events to plugins. After migrating to scenes, application lifecycle events may not work the same as before. Therefore, we need to migrate to scene lifecycle events.

## Prerequisites 

* https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/174395

## Proposal

Introduce a `FlutterPluginSceneLifeCycleDelegate` to `FlutterEngine`. `FlutterPluginSceneLifeCycleDelegate` will hold a weak array to all registered plugins.

The `FlutterSceneDelegate` will forward scene lifecycle events to all [associated engines](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/174395), which will then forward the event to the `FlutterPluginSceneLifeCycleDelegate`, which will then forward the events to the plugins.

`FlutterSceneDelegate.mm`:

```objc
- (void)sceneDidBecomeActive:(UIScene*)scene {
 for (FlutterEngine* engine in [_engines allObjects]) {
   if (!engine) {
     continue;
   }
   [engine.sceneLifeCycleDelegate sceneDidBecomeActive:scene];
 }
}
```

```objc
@implementation FlutterPluginSceneLifeCycleDelegate {
  // Weak references to registered plugins.
  NSPointerArray* _delegates;
}

- (instancetype)init {
  if (self = [super init]) {
    _delegates = [NSPointerArray weakObjectsPointerArray];
  }

174395,"## Problem
Flutter does certain things in response to lifecycle events. After migrating to scenes, application lifecycle events may not work the same as before. Therefore, we need to migrate to scene lifecycle events. However, we need to consider that there could be multiple scene, which could have multiple engines. As such, we should track engines that are associated with the scene.

## Proposal

When a `FlutterViewController` is added to the scene, we should add its `FlutterEngine` to the `FlutterSceneDelegate`.

`FlutterSceneDelegate.mm`:

```
_engines = [NSPointerArray weakObjectsPointerArray];

...

- (void)addFlutterViewController:(FlutterViewController*)controller {
  NSLog(@""Engine added to scene"");

  // NSPointerArray is clever and assumes that unless a mutation operation has occurred on it that
  // has set one of its values to nil, nothing could have changed and it can skip compaction.
  // That's reasonable behaviour on a regular NSPointerArray but not for a weakObjectPointerArray.
  // As a workaround, we mutate it first. See: http://www.openradar.me/15396578
  [self.engines addPointer:nil];
  [self.engines compact];

  // Check if the engine is already in the array to avoid duplicates.
  if (![self.engines.allObjects containsObject:controller.engine]) {
    [self.engines addPointer:(__bridge void*)controller.engine];
  }

  [controller.engine.sceneLifeCycleDelegate flutterViewController:controller
                                                didConnectToScene:(UIScene*)self
                                                          options:self.sceneConnectionOptions];
}
```

`FlutterViewController`:
```
- (void)viewIsAppearing:(BOOL)animated {
  FML_LOG(ERROR) << ""viewIsAppearing"";
  [self connectFlutterViewControllerWithScene];
  [super viewIsAppearing:animated];
}

- (void)connectFlutterViewControllerWithScene {
  // The scene is not available until viewIsAppearing
  UIWindowScene* scene = self.view.window.windowScene;

  // self.view.window.windowScene
  if ([scene.delegate conformsToProtocol:@protocol(FlutterSceneLifeCycleProvider)]) {
    id<FlutterSceneLifeCycleProvider> lifeCycleProvider =
        (id<FlutterSceneLifeCycleProvider>)scene.delegate;
    [lifeCycleProvider addFlutterViewController:self];
  }
}
```

See [prototype](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/compare/master...vashworth:flutter:uiscene_lifecycle_wip).",,
173357,"## Problem 

Due to changes in initialization order, accessing the FlutterViewController from the application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:) method no longer works and will result in a crash (after migrating to UIScene). 

Flutter’s official documentation was to [set up app-level method channels in application:didFinishLaunching:](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/platform-channels#step-4-add-an-ios-platform-specific-implementation).

```
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication*)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary*)launchOptions {
  FlutterViewController* controller = (FlutterViewController*)self.window.rootViewController;

  FlutterMethodChannel* batteryChannel = [FlutterMethodChannel
                                    methodChannelWithName:@""samples.flutter.dev/battery""
                                          binaryMessenger:controller.binaryMessenger];
```

To mitigate this, https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/169399 introduced a callback called `registerWithRegistry` that can be used in a iOS project's AppDelegate. This callback returns an object that conforms to `FlutterPluginRegistry`. The `FlutterAppDelegate`, `FlutterEngine`, and `FlutterViewController` all conform to this protocol. 

```
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication*)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary*)launchOptions {
  self.pluginRegistrant = self;
  return [super application:application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:launchOptions];
}

- (void)registerWithRegistry:(NSObject<FlutterPluginRegistry>*)registry {
  [GeneratedPluginRegistrant registerWithRegistry:registry];
}
```

However, to create a method channel you need a `binaryMessenger`.

## Proposal

Introduce a new base protocol, called `FlutterBaseRegistrar`, make [`FlutterPluginRegistrar`](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/96933bf400e4a927facab702a74129ce4ae17065/engine/src/flutter/shell/platform/darwin/ios/framework/Headers/FlutterPlugin.h#L283-L380) inherit from it, and move most methods up to the base.

Plugin specific methods can stay in `FlutterPluginRegistrar`, such as:
* addApplicationDelegate:, as application authors can do this directly instead.
* lookupKeyForAsset:*, as it’s not clear that this has a use case in the app context. (It could easily be moved up later if there is a use case).
* publish:, which similarly does not seem likely to be useful in the app context.

Introduce a new sibling protocol to `FlutterPluginRegistrar` called `FlutterApplicationRegistrar`, which inherits from the same base. For now this would have no new methods, but by adding this intermediate layer we can trivially add app-specific methods later if needed, without breaking changes or new delegate methods.

Then add a property to `FlutterPluginRegistry`:

```
- (nonnull NSObject<FlutterPluginRegistrar>*)registrarForApplication;
```

The implementation of `registrarForApplication` would create a `FlutterEngineRegistrar` with a unique identifier and register it to the engine: 
https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/96933bf400e4a927facab702a74129ce4ae17065/engine/src/flutter/shell/platform/darwin/ios/framework/Source/FlutterEngine.mm#L1310-L1317

Then from a developer's `AppDelegate`, they can do the following:

```
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication*)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary*)launchOptions {
  self.pluginRegistrant = self;
  return [super application:application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:launchOptions];
}

- (void)registerWithRegistry:(NSObject<FlutterPluginRegistry>*)registry {
  NSObject<FlutterPluginRegistrar>* registrar = registry.registrarForApplication;
  FlutterMethodChannel* batteryChannel = [FlutterMethodChannel
                                    methodChannelWithName:@""samples.flutter.dev/battery""
                                          binaryMessenger:registrar.messenger];
  
  [GeneratedPluginRegistrant registerWithRegistry:registry];
}
```

174432,"This PR addresses performance issues (#106521) in `ExpansionPanelList` by implementing individual animation controllers and optimized rendering. 

Issue #106521 initially suggested implementing a Sliver-based approach. However, after investigation, this approach would introduce breaking changes to `ExpansionPanelList` layout behavior. Existing applications rely on `ExpansionPanelList` working within fixed-height containers.

This PR takes a more conservative approach that delivers performance improvements.

### Key Changes

- **Individual Animation Controllers**: Each expansion panel now uses its own AnimationController, allowing multiple panels to animate concurrently without interference
- **Optimized Rendering**: AnimatedBuilder now uses the child parameter to prevent unnecessary rebuilds of panel body content during animations  

### Testing

- Added regression test for concurrent animation performance verification

### Existing issue?

- [X] I checked the [existing issues](https://github.com/material-foundation/flutter-packages/issues)

### What happened?

## Expected vs actual result:
The digit ""8"" is broken at font-weight 200 and 300, starting at a certain font size. Later, I discovered that the capital letter 'Q' was also broken in some font-weights!!!

## Expected vs actual result:

---

## Steps to reproduce:
1. `import 'package:google_fonts/google_fonts.dart';`
2. Use `GoogleFonts.robotoFlex` with a higher weight e.g. 800 (ExtraBold), 900 (Black), 1000. 
Example: 
```
  Text(
    'Whereas recognition of the inherent dignity',
    style: GoogleFonts.robotoFlex(
      fontSize: 96,
      fontWeight: FontWeight.w900,
    )
  ),
```

Note: There is an existing issue about this which was raised about a year ago in 2022 in https://github.com/material-foundation/flutter-packages/issues/263, but it was closed incorrectly. The user was incorrectly told: ""Please ask a support forum (e.g. StackOverflow, Discord, Reddit) for more help. GitHub issues are meant for feature requests and bug reports.""

This is **not** an issue of the user needing help and it should not have been closed. **This is a bug.** 

The font does not render correctly according to Google's specifications using `google_fonts`, which should happen when specifying the font at higher weights (e.g. 900), so Roboto Flex isn't supported properly. I've also tried to use the `FontVariation` class with the wght axis, which also does not work. This a bummer as Google did a whole design blog post about variable fonts and Roboto Flex, and it would be nice if this worked in Flutter. It would be good to know if there was a workaround in the meantime as well - like maybe with a specific `.ttf` file.

The fonts get displayed correctly in the expected font-weight and the warning disappears, when the inline style attribute: ""font-weight: (e.g.) 600;"" gets removed or when the value gets changed to anything below 600 (e.g. ""font-weight: 500;"") in the web-inspector (see attachment 2). 

With CanvasKit renderer there is no such warning in Webkit browsers and the fonts get displayed correctly.
 
In Chromium based web browsers the fonts get displayed correctly with both - HTML and CanvasKit web-renderer. The inline style attribute e.g.: ""font-weight: 600;"" gets ignored - removing it makes no difference - the fonts get always displayed correctly (also with the correct font-weight).

## Steps to reproduce:
1. Add GoogleFonts to pubspec yaml.
2. Import GoogleFonts
3. Use any GoogleFont with a font-weight above 500
4. Run the app with HTML web-renderer
5. Open the app in a webkit browser (e.g. macOS Safari Version 16.5)
6. Open the web-inspector and find the text element in the Shadow Content
7. Switch to inspect font

### What happened?

## GoogleFonts TextTheme Color defined to always use M2 light mode color

GoogleFonts TextTheme have their TextStyle colors hard coded to M2 light mode colors.

When using a GoogleFonts text theme, like e.g. `GoogleFonts.notoSansTextTheme()` it always comes with the colors from `ThemeData.light().textTheme` baked in as default color.

These TextTheme colors are only appropriate in `ThemeData(textTheme: ..., ...)` for M2 light mode. They are wrong default colors for all other modes, like dark M2, light or dark M3 and primaryTextTheme. Thus, when used for such cases as `TextTheme` in `ThemeData`, the colors have to be overridden for every TextStyle in the TextTheme to get mode correct or even usable contrast color.

If the used `TextStyle` colors in all the GoogleFonts TextThemes were null, `ThemeData` would add M2/M3 mode and light/dark appropriate colors to the GoogleFonts TextThemes when used in a theme.

The GoogleFonts TextThemes already have **NO font sizes defined**, since `ThemeData.light().textTheme` used as default does not yet resolve sizes, they are all null and get applied later in the localization step, this fact gives us M2/M3 mode correct sizes, but not colors. 

Letting `Color` remain null in all `GoogleFonts` text themes and be applied by `ThemeData` to appropriate colors would be similar behavior for color and make the default GoogleFonts TextTheme get correct M2 (opacity based) based contrast colors in M2 and M3 (onSurface based) colors in M3 mode as well as correct contrast colors for light/dark mode.

Even when used as `primaryTextTheme`, color would be resolved based on `ThemeData` modes, with the known issue and limitation `primaryTextTheme` has see Flutter [issue #118146](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/118146).


Build the attached sample app to see the result. Toggle the switch ON to see expected results, keep OFF to see issues as presented below.


### Expected results

Expect to get M2/M3 mode and light/dark mode correct contrast color on the text when using `GoogleFonts` as `TextTheme` in `ThemeData` when used as `textTheme` and `primaryTextTheme`.

> **NOTE:** The dark mode `primaryTextTheme` above have wrong contrast colors, but that is due to unrelated `ThemeData` [issue #118146](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/118146).


### Actual results

| M3 light | M3 dark |
|----------|---------|
| ![Screenshot 2023-05-15 at 6 07 49](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/assets/39990307/8271401b-f39b-4822-a893-cfd7e9ea0909) | ![Screenshot 2023-05-15 at 6 08 14](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/assets/39990307/be0051e8-cb20-4cad-ac7e-7c851c1b25ee) |

In M3 light mode, the `textTheme` colors get M2 light mode based colors with its different opacities for different styles. This is incorrect, they should all be `onSurface` color with no opacity.

The `primaryTextTheme` is also M2 light mode text theme based, not only is it incorrect, it is also incorrect contrast for the used `primary` color.

In M3 dark mode, the same M2 light mode colors are used, they are not usable at all as colors on a dark mode `textTheme`. 

Ironically, in dark mode, the light M2 theme mode font colors happen to work better on `primary` color than what `ThemeData` actually makes when colors are null. As mentioned, the reason for this is [issue #118146](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/118146) and unrelated to this case.

In M2 light mode, the colors are actually correct for `textTheme`.
> Well for `Typography2014` anyway, I don't remember if it is actually correct for M2 `Typography2018` as well, or if 2018 changed any of the opacities used from 2014. I seem to recall they did not, it was just font sizes and some letter spacing. In this example that uses just vanilla `ThemeData` we get the very old `Typography2014` that actually don't use correct M2 sizes and letter spacing, but if we were to change to `Typography2018` we would get the correct M2 sizes. So that part works, but colors would remain with 2014 opacities, but as I recall, they are the same as 2018, so they are most likely correct ""by accident"".


In M2 dark mode, the `textTheme` uses the M2 light mode colors, and they are of course not legible at all. Again, in this case due mentioned unrelated issue, the dark mode `primaryTextTheme` is better than what `ThemeData` would actually make if colors were null.


### Proposal

Keep `color` null in all returned GoogleFonts TextThemes and all their TextStyles, and let `ThemeData` apply appropriate default colors. Users can still apply their own colors as needed.

The change is potentially breaking, but it makes `GoogleFonts` default TextThemes better in all `ThemeData` modes in Flutter. Importantly, it also gives us correct M3 mode font colors by default when we use M3.

If the **hard coded** M2 light mode colors for some reason are critical in the current `TextThemes` returned by `GoogleFonts`, maybe consider adding another new `TextTheme` getter where all `TextStyle` colors are null. This, as a more suitable optional/new default `TextTheme` more usable and suitable for `ThemeData` consumption.

Currently, I'm using a version of the fix presented in the attached sample in FlexColorScheme. As seen, I found a ""reasonably"" safe way to check when a given passed `TextTheme` is using a default GoogleFonts TextTheme, and only set colors to null then. It would be nice to not need this workaround. but I can of course continue to use it. Still it might also be nice to not have all users of GoogleFonts that use vanilla `ThemeData` struggle with this issue.

### Issue sample code

The reproduction sample code is attached below.

#### Sample build requirements

Add GoogleFonts to pubspec yaml.


```yaml
dependencies:
  google_fonts: ^4.0.4
```

If using **macOS** add:

```xml
<key>com.apple.security.network.client</key>
<true/>
```
To at least the macOS debug mode entitlements file.

### Description

My dart server has the function to create the pdf file but my Thai language doesn't support it with the default font on the [pdf package](https://pub.dev/packages/pdf). Then I want to use the font from this package.
But it looks like this package doesn't support the Dart server side.
I got this error after running the server.

1. Run the sample code
2. Use a trackpad gesture (e.g. two-finger pinch or scroll) over the blue box.
3. Observe that no pan/zoom events are printed to the console.


### Expected results

Pointer pan/zoom gestures (e.g. trackpad pinch or pan) should trigger the corresponding callbacks.

### Actual results

No PointerPanZoom events are triggered on Web. The same code works as expected on macOS.

### Existing issue?

- [X] I checked the [existing issues](https://github.com/material-foundation/flutter-packages/issues)

### What happened?

google_fonts library JavaScript itself has the file size of 8Mb.
It is only library JavaScript, so fonts are loaded additionally and have their own file sizes.

Might be nice to reduce the library JavaScript file size to something acceptable for the web.

## Expected vs actual result:
Letters are rendered correctly whether the Roboto font is loaded through google_fonts or not.

## Steps to reproduce:
See attached code.
The text is rendered perfectly fine as long as you don't load the Google Font. Once loaded, the ""Roboto_regular' text breaks.
Is the 'regular' variant of Roboto not the default one ?

  runApp(const MaterialApp(
    home: MyHomePage(),

174567,"## Steps to Reproduce

I am about to use a bundled version of a font, the documentation says:

> Note: Since these files are listed as assets, there is no need to list them in the fonts section of the pubspec.yaml. This can be done because the files are consistently named from the Google Fonts API (so be sure not to rename them!)

I did the same for [`Plus Jakarta Sans`](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Plus+Jakarta+Sans?query=Plus+#standard-styles) with `allowRuntimeFetching = false` but this lead to the error:

```
I/flutter ( 9128): Error: google_fonts was unable to load font PlusJakartaSans-Regular because the following exception occurred:
I/flutter ( 9128): Exception: GoogleFonts.config.allowRuntimeFetching is false but font PlusJakartaSans-Regular was not found in the application assets. Ensure PlusJakartaSans-Regular.ttf exists in a folder that is included in your pubspec's assets.
```

Which makes sense as I don't have `PlusJakartaSans-Regular.ttf` in the assets but `PlusJakartaSans-VariableFont_wght.ttf` which is the one you get when downloading from Google Fonts. 


**Expected results:** 
The variable font should be used.

**Actual results:** <!-- what did you see? -->
It does not get used


**Additional context** 
A workaround for just downloading the regular variant is also not possible, since when you just select the regular style on fonts.google.com also only the variable font is downloaded

https://fonts.google.com/share?selection.family=Plus%20Jakarta%20Sans




",,
174568,"**Describe the bug**
During golden tests, I noticed that any font coming from google_fonts is missing in the first golden. Creating the same golden again (with pumping the widget again) then works. 


**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
Take the default main app and add a font from the google_fonts package:
```
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:google_fonts/google_fonts.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: MyHomePage(title: 'Flutter Demo Home Page'),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  MyHomePage({Key? key, required this.title}) : super(key: key);
  final String title;

  @override
  _MyHomePageState createState() => _MyHomePageState();
}

class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  int _counter = 0;

  void _incrementCounter() {
    setState(() {
      _counter++;
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text(widget.title)),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              'You have pushed the button this many times:',
              style: TextStyle(fontFamily: 'Teko'),
            ),
            Text(
              '$_counter',
              style: GoogleFonts.lato(
                fontSize: 20,
                fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,
              ),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: _incrementCounter,
        tooltip: 'Increment',
        child: Icon(Icons.add),
      ), // This trailing comma makes auto-formatting nicer for build methods.
    );
  }
}
```

Running the following tests: 
```
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart';

import 'package:example/main.dart';

void main() {
  testWidgets('Counter increments smoke test', (WidgetTester tester) async {
    await tester.pumpWidget(MaterialApp(home: MyHomePage(title: 'Test')));

    await expectLater(
        find.byType(MyHomePage), matchesGoldenFile('goldens/test1.png'));
  });

  testWidgets('Counter increments smoke test', (WidgetTester tester) async {
    await tester.pumpWidget(MaterialApp(home: MyHomePage(title: 'Test')));

    await expectLater(
        find.byType(MyHomePage), matchesGoldenFile('goldens/test2.png'));
  });
}
```

**Expected behavior**
Both Goldens should look identical. Only the counter is of interest here. The other text that does not load properly is not relevant here. 

**Include the contents of your `google_fonts` directory**
Pubspec.yaml:
```
flutter:
  uses-material-design: true
  assets:
    - images/
    - google_fonts/
```

174211,"### Steps to reproduce

1. Run the sample code
2. Use a laptop trackpad to zoom
3. Observe that both callbacks fire repeatedly during the gesture.

### Expected results

onInteractionStart should fire once when the user begins an interaction .
onInteractionEnd should fire once when the user ends the interaction.

### Actual results

Both callbacks fire every frame update of the gesture. 
This does not happen on MacOS

174569,"Would be great if it was possible to use the loaded font as a fallback ex. something like 
```
  GoogleFonts.getFont('Noto Color Emoji Compat')

  Text(
      'Hello 👋',
      style: TextStyle(
        fontFamilyFallback: ['Noto Color Emoji Compat'],

The scenario where it would be useful is if we want to have a default font, but if it doesn't have a specific emoji (very common on older Android versions), fallback to a dynamically loaded emoji font. I know it is possible if you include emoji font in the asset folder, but it increases the app file size.",,
174570,"I know that Flutter ""rounds"" your weight selection to the nearest available, but how do you find all the available weights for a font? I couldn't find any method that does this.

For example, if I had a font selector with weight, how would I let the user select semibold/bold/black in one font, but just regular/light in the other? If I display the 9 options and ask to choose one, it would be trial and error.",,

- [ ] causing severe production issues e.g. malfunctions or data loss
- [ ] blocking next binary release
- [X] blocking a client feature launch within a quarter
- [ ] nice-to-have but does not block a launch within the next quarter

### Steps to reproduce

1. Using a screenreader such as Voiceover, focus on the first button
2. Click the first button using the screenreader
3. Observe that the focus jumps forward to the next button
4. Click the second button using the screenreader
5. Observe that the focus jumps backwards to the first button

### Expected results

When clicking a button using a screenreader, the focus should remain on that button.

### Actual results

The focus jumps forward or backwards if a button's state changes to include an icon.

Currently, SearchAnchor does not expose smartQuotesType or smartDashesType for the TextField it manages internally. This prevents developers from controlling smart quotes and smart dashes behavior when using SearchAnchor, even though they can do so directly on a standalone TextField.

`google_fonts`

### Description

If you ran into this error, it means that an attempt was made to fetch a font TTF file from Google Fonts' servers, but failed. For example:

```
Exception has occurred.
_Exception (Exception: Failed to load font with url https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/a/85fcd167f63837ebb1c310a8e83bf1d5039fbbd5a13ac4812691d52817631161.ttf: Failed host lookup: 'fonts.gstatic.com')
```

### Solution

The most common reason is the device/emulator/simulator doesn't have internet access. 

- For macOS and Android, you must allow HTTP requests following [these instructions](https://docs.flutter.dev/data-and-backend/networking#platform-notes)
- If this occurred in a test, see https://github.com/material-foundation/flutter-packages/blob/main/packages/google_fonts/example/test for how to set up things properly
- Your device/emulator/simulator may not be connected to Wi-Fi or a mobile network
- Your Internet Service Provider (ISP) (e.g. in China) may be blocking the request
- (Highly unlikely) The URL may be invalid, or Google Fonts may be down. Navigate to https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/a/85fcd167f63837ebb1c310a8e83bf1d5039fbbd5a13ac4812691d52817631161.ttf to verify.

### Background 
The default behavior for this package is to fetch (and cache) fonts from the Internet at runtime. Including chosen fonts at build time is also supported, instructions for doing this are in the README.

### Still need help?
If you ran into this issue and have eliminated all possible causes listed above, please comment with all relevant information (Wi-Fi / mobile network, target device & OS, `flutter version -v`, etc.)",,
156910,"### Document Link

https://flutter.dev/go/web-cleanup-service-worker

### What problem are you solving?

The current default service worker implementation is one of (several) approaches that can be used by Flutter web, however it's not a good fit for all use-cases.

This confuses users when it doesn't behave as they expect.

Having a default service worker implementation sends the message that it is *necessary* or *recommended* by Flutter web to function correctly, but that is not the case.

This design doc discusses how the current implementation of `flutter_service_worker.js` is going to be phased out (TL;DR: with a cleanup service worker for those currently using the default one), and how the flutter tools and flutter.js will eventually stop generating (or loading) a default service worker, allowing web app developers to do what's best for their specific apps.",,

### Existing issue?

### What happened?

## Expected result:
All characters (Arabic and Latin) in a Text widget that uses NotoSansArabic (via google_fonts or a bundled TTF) are rendered in the same color, weight, and baseline on every supported Android version, including Android 16.

Switching the device/app locale must not change the consistency of the glyph rendering.

## Actual result:
On Android 16 (API 35) only, Latin glyphs in a mixed string (اهلا و سهلا Hello) appear much lighter / grey than the Arabic glyphs—even though the entire Text is given color: Colors.black.

The mismatch persists after hot‑reload, full restart, and locale changes; it does not occur on Android 14 or iOS 17.

No runtime errors or warnings are printed in flutter run -v.

4. Run on Android 16 (emulator or physical).

5. Observe the Latin glyphs appear lighter/grey compared with Arabic glyphs.

6. Repeat the same build on Android 14 or iOS 17 → both scripts render identically, confirming the regression is Android 16‑specific.

The default proxy setup for Flutter web doesn't allow developers to easily inject custom HTTP headers into their requests. This becomes a significant roadblock when a developer is building a Flutter web app that needs to communicate with an API that requires an authorization header (e.g., a JWT or OAuth token) to authenticate a user. Without the ability to add this header, all authenticated API calls fail with CORS errors during local development. While this is less of an issue in production where the app and API might be on the same domain or the server is configured to handle CORS, it hinders the development and testing process.

I've tried disabling web security in the browser by launching Chrome with the --disable-web-security flag to bypass CORS entirely. However, this is a major security risk and is not a viable solution for a production environment. It's also not a great option for a development team since it requires every developer to configure their browser in a specific way, which can lead to inconsistencies.





### Proposal

Use the headers method that injects headers from the web_dev_config.yaml file to get headers from the proxy rule as well. This can be injected when the proxy middleware makes a request.",,

## Steps to Reproduce

<!-- Please include full steps to reproduce so that we can reproduce the problem. -->

1. Execute `flutter run` on the code sample (see ""Code sample"" section below) or on the code on https://github.com/ValentinVignal/flutter_app_stable/tree/update-dialog-theme
2. Click on the button ""Show dialog"" and update the theme (it works)
4. Close the dialog
5. Click on the button ""Show dialog with overridden theme"" and update the theme
6. Notice the dialog theme is not updated.

**Expected results:** <!-- what did you want to see? -->

The dialog's theme should updated as well as the rest of the app.

**Actual results:** <!-- what did you see? -->

The dialog's theme is not updated.

<!--
      Please create a minimal reproducible sample that shows the problem
      and attach it below between the lines with the backticks.

      To create it you can use `flutter create bug` command and update the `main.dart` file.

      Alternatively, you can use https://dartpad.dev/
      which is capable of creating and running small Flutter apps.

      Without this we will unlikely be able to progress on the issue, and because of that
      we regretfully will have to close it.

### Existing issue?

- [x] I checked the [existing issues](https://github.com/material-foundation/flutter-packages/issues)

### What happened?

## Expected vs actual result:
When using `GoogleFonts.instrumentSans().fontFamily` with `FontWeight.bold`, the font appears light during development/debug mode, even though bold is specified.

Expected:
	•	The font should appear bold when `FontWeight.bold` is used, even in debug mode.

Actual:
	•	The font renders with light weight during debug mode.
	•	However, in release mode, the font correctly appears bold.

This inconsistency makes it very hard to design and test the UI reliably during development.

## Steps to reproduce:

1. Use `GoogleFonts.instrumentSans().fontFamily` or any of existing font family in a Flutter widget.
2. Set the style to use `FontWeight.bold`.
3. Run the app in debug mode, the font appears light.
4. Build and run the app in release mode, the font appears correctly as bold.

      const GoogleFontsVariant(
        fontWeight: FontWeight.w300,
        fontStyle: FontStyle.normal,
      ): GoogleFontsFile(

google_fonts

### Description



```dart

 final  List<TextStyle>  allgermanStyle  = GoogleFonts.allfont.where((element) => element.language == 'german').toList();
```",,
174545,"### **Description:**

There is a systematic inconsistency in how fontFamily names are handled for multi-word font families in the google_fonts package. Specifically:

In the asMap function, font family names retain their spaces (e.g., 'ADLaM Display').
However, in the googleFontsTextStyle function, these spaces are removed (e.g., 'ADLaMDisplay').
This creates a mismatch between the asMap keys and the actual fontFamily values passed to googleFontsTextStyle.

### **Example:**
For the font family ADLaM Display:

In asMap:

`'ADLaM Display': PartA.aDLaMDisplay,`

In the aDLaMDisplay function:

`fontFamily: 'ADLaMDisplay',`

This mismatch causes issues when attempting to use fontFamily values programmatically (e.g., retrieving font families dynamically via asMap).

### **Additional Context:**

According to the [Google Fonts API](https://fonts.google.com/), font family names are returned with spaces (e.g., 'ADLaM Display').
Removing spaces from fontFamily values in googleFontsTextStyle creates unnecessary inconsistencies and may lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

### **Suggested Fix:**

Ensure that fontFamily values in both asMap and googleFontsTextStyle retain their spaces to match the naming convention used by Google Fonts (e.g., 'ADLaM Display').

173520,"Fixes #173514

## Description

Added support for manual high contrast theme mode control in MaterialApp. This allows developers to explicitly control the high contrast theme mode independently of the system settings, similar to how `themeMode` works for light/dark themes.

Changes include:
- Added `HighContrastThemeMode` enum with `system`, `enabled`, and `disabled` values
- Added `highContrastThemeMode` property to MaterialApp
- Updated theme resolution logic to respect manual high contrast settings
- Added comprehensive test coverage

## Test Plan

Added new test cases in `packages/flutter/test/material/app_test.dart` covering:
- Default behavior (system)
- Explicit enable/disable
- Interaction with platform settings
- State restoration
- Theme inheritance

All tests are passing.

## Breaking Change

No breaking changes. This is a new opt-in feature that maintains backward compatibility with existing apps.",,

google_fonts

### Description

### **Description:**

Currently, the google_fonts package does not provide a direct mechanism to retrieve all available variants (e.g., font weights, styles) for a specific font family at runtime. While the package correctly prioritizes locally bundled font files over HTTP fetching, there is no way to programmatically access the available GoogleFontsVariant list for a given font family.

### **Feature Request**
I propose adding an official way to expose font variants for a font family dynamically, without requiring external APIs or manual mapping. This feature would benefit developers by providing:

1. A dynamic mechanism to query GoogleFontsVariant for any font family at runtime.
2. Better error handling for unsupported weights or styles by letting developers check available variants before applying them.
3. Improved visibility into locally bundled font assets for debugging and customization purposes.

### **Current Hack**
I have implemented a hack to achieve this functionality by modifying the google_fonts_base.dart file as follows:

1. Added a New fontsVariants Map in GoogleFonts.config: I extended the GoogleFonts.config object to include a map that dynamically tracks font family variants during runtime:

`Map<String, List<GoogleFontsVariant>> fontsVariants = {};
`

2. Modified googleFontsTextStyle: I updated the googleFontsTextStyle function to dynamically populate a fontsVariants map in the GoogleFonts.config object:

```
final variants = GoogleFonts.config.fontsVariants;
if (!variants.containsKey(fontFamily)) {
  variants[fontFamily] = fonts.keys.toList(growable: false);
}

```

3. Added a Function: I created a method to retrieve the variants for a font family:

```
static List<GoogleFontsVariant> getFontsVariants(String fontFamily) {
  final fonts = GoogleFonts.asMap();
  final font = fonts[fontFamily];

  if (font == null) {
    throw Exception(""No font family by name '$fontFamily' was found."");
  }

  final variants = GoogleFonts.config.fontsVariants;

  if (!variants.containsKey(fontFamily)) {
    font();
  }

  return List.of(variants[fontFamily]!);
}
```

However, since google_fonts.dart is a generated file, I cannot submit a direct pull request for this change. This is purely a hack solution, and the proper implementation should involve modifying the generator to handle this more effectively.

### **Suggested Solution**
A better approach would be to modify the google_fonts generator to maintain a centralized list of all GoogleFontsVariant for each font family. Currently, each font family function generates its own variants and passes them as parameters to the googleFontsTextStyle() function. By extracting and storing these variants in a separate list or map, the package can provide a much cleaner and official way to query them.

For example:

- Maintain a global list or map that holds all font families and their respective GoogleFontsVariant.
- This list can be used to expose the variants through a public API without requiring additional calls to the font family functions.

### **Benefits**

- Improved Developer Experience: Developers can programmatically query available font variants instead of relying on trial-and-error or manual mapping.
- Dynamic and Offline-First: No need for external APIs or hardcoded variant mappings, enabling a fully offline workflow.
- Better Error Handling: Prevents issues where unsupported weights or styles are silently ignored by Flutter.

### **Example Use Case**

```
final availableVariants = GoogleFonts.getFontsVariants('Roboto');
print(availableVariants); // Outputs all supported weights/styles for 'Roboto'
```

## Expected vs actual result:
When I use the font ""Noto Color Emoji"", it doesn't render any emojis.
Other fonts like Roboto, Kanit and others works fine.

```
            Text('Google Fonts 😊 Kanit',
                style: GoogleFonts.kanit(
                  textStyle: const TextStyle(fontSize: 20),

### Description

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
I would like to access all fonts in a simple list like ""GoogleFonts.fonts"".
Therefor the only function to achieve something like this is ""GoogleFonts.asMap()"" which returns all fonts as String/Builder Function pair.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Wouldn't it be easier for the whole library to put all fonts in enumes?
like 
```dart
 typedef TextStyleBuilder = TextStyle Function({
  TextStyle? textStyle,
  Color? color,
  Color? backgroundColor,
  double? fontSize,
  FontWeight? fontWeight,
  FontStyle? fontStyle,
  double? letterSpacing,
  double? wordSpacing,
  TextBaseline? textBaseline,
  double? height,
  Locale? locale,
  Paint? foreground,
  Paint? background,
  List<ui.Shadow>? shadows,
  List<ui.FontFeature>? fontFeatures,
  TextDecoration? decoration,
  Color? decorationColor,
  TextDecorationStyle? decorationStyle,
  double? decorationThickness,
});


enum GoogleFont {
  ABeeZee,
  ADLaM_Display;
  // ...

  final String name;
  final TextStyleBuilder builder;
}
```

This way, one could easily retrieve a list of all fonts, could check if a given font is valid and pass the font typesafe around instead of holding a String.



**Describe alternatives you've considered**
Possibly another ""improvement"" (excuse me that i don't open another issue for that) would be to reduce the ""static TextTheme almaraiTextTheme([TextTheme? textTheme])"" TextThemeBuilder functions that are probably auto generated, with a simple callback like:

```dart
// Example almari function:
  static TextTheme almaraiTextTheme([TextTheme? textTheme]) {
    textTheme ??= ThemeData.light().textTheme;
    return TextTheme(
      displayLarge: almarai(textStyle: textTheme.displayLarge),
      displayMedium: almarai(textStyle: textTheme.displayMedium),
      displaySmall: almarai(textStyle: textTheme.displaySmall),
      headlineLarge: almarai(textStyle: textTheme.headlineLarge),
      headlineMedium: almarai(textStyle: textTheme.headlineMedium),
      headlineSmall: almarai(textStyle: textTheme.headlineSmall),
      titleLarge: almarai(textStyle: textTheme.titleLarge),
      titleMedium: almarai(textStyle: textTheme.titleMedium),
      titleSmall: almarai(textStyle: textTheme.titleSmall),
      bodyLarge: almarai(textStyle: textTheme.bodyLarge),
      bodyMedium: almarai(textStyle: textTheme.bodyMedium),
      bodySmall: almarai(textStyle: textTheme.bodySmall),
      labelLarge: almarai(textStyle: textTheme.labelLarge),
      labelMedium: almarai(textStyle: textTheme.labelMedium),
      labelSmall: almarai(textStyle: textTheme.labelSmall),
    );
  }

// to:
 static TextTheme almaraiTextTheme([TextTheme? textTheme]) {
    textTheme ??= ThemeData.light().textTheme;
    return googleFontTextTheme(GoogleFont.almari);
 }

static TextTheme googleFontTextTheme(TextStyleBuilder builder, [TextTheme? textTheme]) {
  textTheme ??= ThemeData.light().textTheme;

  return TextTheme(
      displayLarge: builder(textStyle: textTheme.displayLarge),
      displayMedium: builder(textStyle: textTheme.displayMedium),
      displaySmall: builder(textStyle: textTheme.displaySmall),
      headlineLarge: builder(textStyle: textTheme.headlineLarge),
      headlineMedium: builder(textStyle: textTheme.headlineMedium),
      headlineSmall: builder(textStyle: textTheme.headlineSmall),
      titleLarge: builder(textStyle: textTheme.titleLarge),
      titleMedium: builder(textStyle: textTheme.titleMedium),
      titleSmall: builder(textStyle: textTheme.titleSmall),
      bodyLarge: builder(textStyle: textTheme.bodyLarge),
      bodyMedium: builder(textStyle: textTheme.bodyMedium),
      bodySmall: builder(textStyle: textTheme.bodySmall),
      labelLarge: builder(textStyle: textTheme.labelLarge),
      labelMedium: builder(textStyle: textTheme.labelMedium),
      labelSmall: builder(textStyle: textTheme.labelSmall),
    );
 }

```

**Additional context**
I am interested if this is an option and why it is currently made the way it is, which looks like a lot of boilerplate for every single GoogleFont for me.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Use a third-party library that uses Pigeon auto-generated message codecs, such as [cloud_functions](https://github.com/firebase/flutterfire/blob/main/packages/cloud_functions/cloud_functions_platform_interface/lib/src/pigeon/messages.pigeon.dart#L38) (or generate own Pigeon code)
2. Send a small Dart `int` (e.g. 1) via Pigeon to iOS native code
3. Receive an Int64 value

I have created a minimal Flutter app that reproduces the downstream issue with `cloud_functions`:
https://github.com/ernesto-elsaesser/cloud-functions-int-bug

However, this issue is about the auto-generated `_PigeonCodec` subclass, i.e. not specific to FlutterFire packages.

### Expected results

I would expect to receive an Int32 on iOS side, if the value passed on Dart side is within Int32 range, as implemented in Flutter's `StandardMessageCodec`: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/main/packages/flutter/lib/src/services/message_codecs.dart#L399

I am aware that the Pigeon behavior was introduced to fix an Android bug: https://github.com/flutter/packages/pull/7725

I also understand that Dart integers might actually be ""native"" Int64s: https://dart.dev/resources/language/number-representation#dart-number-representation

However, this [overridden codec](https://github.com/flutter/packages/blob/main/packages/pigeon/lib/src/dart/dart_generator.dart#L460) introduces new issues downstream, if Int64 are handled different than Int32s.
See https://github.com/firebase/flutterfire/issues/17587

Currently, the Pigeon Dart templates don't seem to provide any way to pass small integers as Int32 from Dart to iOS.

### Actual results

Receive an Int64 in iOS native code.

I believe the root cause is this line in `InheritedModel`: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/9c626d9f9afa6da96433e3bfc4895492f87e0009/packages/flutter/lib/src/widgets/inherited_model.dart#L160 The code assumes that `model.widget` is of type `T`, and for some reason that is failing. The issue could also be the call to `model.widget`, which under the hood has a null check on the actual field: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/9c626d9f9afa6da96433e3bfc4895492f87e0009/packages/flutter/lib/src/widgets/framework.dart#L3598.

You could pass in the presentation of an empty step and attach the links to that step instead as a workaround. Or change your subbuild module to add the links to the schedule step. If the schedule step ends up being the only step there, then maybe the nesting isn't needed at all? You could even change the step_name of schedule to launch builds and add the links there directly. You may even be able to remove the id based links.

### Existing issue?

- [X] I checked the [existing issues](https://github.com/material-foundation/flutter-packages/issues)

### What happened?

## Expected vs actual result:

Expected: The non-breaking hypen should be displayed as a hyphen
Actual: The non-brekaing hyphen is displayed as a small underscore (See attached screenshot).

## Steps to reproduce:

Here is a minimal Flutter app to reproduce this problem:

Note: I could not reproduce it with https://dartpad.dev !? But the error should be reproducible on an Android device.

```
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:google_fonts/google_fonts.dart';

void main() => runApp(MyApp());

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Non-Breaking Hyphen Demo',
      debugShowCheckedModeBanner: false,
      home: MyDemoPage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyDemoPage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Non-Breaking Hyphen Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisSize: MainAxisSize.min,
          crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text('Default-Font:', style: TextStyle(fontWeight: FontWeight.bold)),
            SizedBox(height: 5),
            Text('With normal hyphen: E-Mail'),
            SizedBox(height: 5),
            Text('With non-breaking hyphen: E\u{2011}Mail'),
            SizedBox(height: 25),
            Text('Poppins:', style: TextStyle(fontWeight: FontWeight.bold)),
            SizedBox(height: 5),
            Text('With normal hyphen: E-Mail', style: GoogleFonts.poppins()),
            SizedBox(height: 5),
            Text('With non-breaking hyphen: E\u{2011}Mail', style: GoogleFonts.poppins()),
          ],

## Steps to Reproduce

<!--
     Please tell us exactly how to reproduce the problem you are running into.

     Please attach a small application (ideally just one main.dart file) that
     reproduces the problem. You could use https://gist.github.com/ for this.

     If the problem is with your application's rendering, then please attach
     a screenshot and explain what the problem is.
-->
getExternalStorageDirectory() returns /storage/emulated/0/Android/data/com.example.shop/files
instead of /storage/emulated/0
Because of this I'm not able to get the image in my gallery. Although if I add the path manually I'm able to store the image.
<!--
     Please tell us which target platform(s) the problem occurs (Android / iOS / Web / macOS / Linux / Windows)
     Which target OS version, for Web, browser, is the test system running?
     Does the problem occur on emulator/simulator as well as on physical devices?
-->

**Target Platform:**Andriod Pie
**Devices:** Both physical and emulator

170737,"### Steps to reproduce

1. Start a Video via Network URL
2. Let the Video finish
3. The loading spinner will appear, meaning the `isBuffering` variable got true
4. After a long wait time, the `isBuffering` value changes to false

### Expected results

If a video finishes, it should not be buffered anymore, so `isBuffering` should stay `false`.

### Actual results

`isBuffering` changes to `true` after the video finishes and stays `true` for a long time (about a minute).
I think this might be related to a previous issue #165149.

173359,"### Overview

Restricts the `--aot-shared-library-name` flag used for launching `FlutterFragment`s to only accept paths that point to the application's internal storage.

### Why restrict the path at all

Currently, when an application launches a `FlutterFragment` with an `Intent` that passes the  `--aot-shared-library-name` flag,  the Flutter engine [will call `dlopen`](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/f45a8f8b719e9c0648d0ac563023522e72a80a00/engine/src/flutter/fml/platform/posix/native_library_posix.cc#L14) on the native code that lives where the passed path points with no checks. So, if that path points to malicious code, we've got a problem. See go/flutter-fragment-flag-security-analysis for full context.

By restricting the path to a trusted location, we ensure that the application developer is either writing their own native code (that we can assume not to be malicious) or is importing third party code and manually packaging it with their application code, ensuring that it has been vetted by the application author (or at least indicating that it should be vetted).

### Why restrict the path to the application's internal storage

The [native code directory within internal storage](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/pm/ApplicationInfo#nativeLibraryDir) is where native JNI libraries are stored by default when the AGP [`useLegacyPackaging` option](https://developer.android.com/build/releases/past-releases/agp-4-2-0-release-notes#compress-native-libs-dsl) is set to true, so any compiled native code that's part of an Android app will live there.

If `useLegacyPackaging` is set to false or the application developer wishes to reference native code some other way, they can manually package it within internal storage, which is generally a secure place to store files for your application needs. Also, as far as I'm aware, this is the only secure place the application developers could reference native code *by path* in their application (for example, developers could put their native code in the `app/src/main/assets` directory, then copy it into internal storage for reference by path).

_My primary sources:_
https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/concepts
https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/add-native-code
https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage

### Prior art

Flutter has enforced a similar sort of path restriction for the `file_selector_android` package; see https://github.com/flutter/packages/pull/8184. Just like that PR does, this PR makes sure to canonicalize paths passed to the flag and attempts to test sneaky partial internal storage paths to mitigate path traversal attacks.

### Future work

As mentioned in my TODO, the pattern of willy-nilly adding any flags passed in an `Intent` to launch a `FlutterFragment` is dangerous. We plan to address this vulnerability in a future PR: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/172553

### P.S. This PR also renames `application_library_path` to `application_library_paths`

This is actually a vector of AOT shared library (plural) paths that can include the one passed with the `--aot-shared-library-name` flag as well as the fallbacks.

### Steps to reproduce

When I try to purchase a 1-month prepaid subscription for the second time using the buyNonConsumable API in the Google Play Console, I receive an error from Google Play: ""We are unable to change your subscription plan."" I can't purchase the subscription again unless I get a refund or the current subscription expires.

Although I see that the `buyNonConsumable` interface has the description: “Non-consumable items can only be bought once.” I've consulted the Google Play Developer website, and it states that a new subscription purchase with the same SKU is allowed for renewal. The [response ](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/thread/366446804/is-a-google-play-prepaid-monthly-base-plan-a-one-time-purchase-before-it-expires?msgid=366455363&authuser=1)I received was: ""You will need to pass the original subscription along with the new order as per the document I linked to.""

Additionally, the same code works perfectly fine for purchasing non-renewing subscriptions on the iOS App Store.


### Expected results

One month before expiration, you can purchase another month.

### Actual results

Error We are unable to change your subscription plan.

",,
170167,"## Problem 
There are many things that can break when migrating to scenes that can be unexpected to developers. For example:
* Accessing FlutterViewController in -[UIApplicateDelegate didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:] crashes
* Some application lifecycle events are no longer called: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/170037 

In addition, after migrating to UIScenes, registering plugins in the `application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)` function is no longer recommended. It will still work by using a new mechanism called FlutterLaunchEngine, but we want to move away from this.


## Proposal 1
Instead of auto-migrating all Flutter apps, we should prompt the user to migrate. This will warn developers about the changes required and will provide helpful documentation.

```
To ensure your app continues to function correctly on upcoming iOS versions, UIScene lifecycle support will soon be required. Would you like to migrate your project now? [Y/N]

If ""Y"" and a customized AppDelegate is detected:

We've detected a customized AppDelegate in your project. To successfully migrate to UIScene, you may need to manually update your AppDelegate file. Failure to do so may lead to unexpected crashes or issues after migrating.

Please follow these instructions to update your AppDelegate: [link]

Would you like to proceed with the migration process? [Y/N]

If ""N"" at any time:

We strongly recommend migrating to UIScene. Failure to adopt UIScene will result in an assert in a future iOS version, which will prevent your app from launching.

For more information on UIScene migration, please refer to our documentation: [link]
```

Their response will be saved using flutter config:
* ios-uiscene-migration-status:
  * success
  * error
  * skipped
  * bypassed

If a user skips the migration process, each flutter run or flutter build for iOS will print a warning message, similar to Xcode. This warning will be built into the  flutter assemble command so it will also appear in Xcode.

```
UIScene lifecycle will soon be required. Failure to adopt will result in an assert in the future. Run flutter config --reset ios-uiscene-migration-prompt and then run flutter build ios --config-only to complete the migration.
```

It’s possible that Flutter won’t be able to detect properly that they have already migrated their app to UIScene (you can migrate using Info.plist or adding code to AppDelegate). In that case, they can bypass the check.

```
flutter config --bypass-ios-uiscene-migration-prompt
```

After bypassing, they will not see anymore Flutter warnings or prompts in regards to UIScene migration.

If they opt to migrate, Flutter will add UIApplicationSceneManifest and its sub-settings to the app’s Info.plist.

It will additionally auto-migrate the AppDelegate file if it’s an exact match to the Flutter create template.

Due to the wide range of changes that may need to be made to the iOS code, the Flutter tool will not attempt other auto-migrations and will instead guide the developer to migrate manually with our documentation.

Manual migrations:
* Accessing FlutterViewController
* Registering plugins
* Registering app-level method channels
* Usage of deprecated APIs

If an error occurs while migrating (e.g. Flutter can’t update the Info.plist), Flutter will guide the developer to the documentation and display the following warning:

```
Flutter was unable to migrate your app to UIScene lifecycle. This will soon be required. Failure to adopt will result in an assert in the future. 

Please complete the following instructions to manually migrate: [link]

After migrating, run ""flutter config --bypass-ios-uiscene-migration-prompt"" to no longer see this warning.
```

## Proposal 2
Instead of prompting the user and auto-migrating, simply provide a message that points to documentation on how to manually migrate.
",,
174414,"integration_test uses the following deprecated APIs and will need to migrate to the scene equivalent:

* [[UIScreen mainScreen]](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/3ceb2e0a48cefa9714b6575f2e04d55f0d850e36/packages/integration_test/ios/integration_test/Sources/integration_test/IntegrationTestPlugin.m#L85) → `self.pluginRegistrar.view.window.windowScene.screen`
* [[UIApplication sharedApplication].windows](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/3ceb2e0a48cefa9714b6575f2e04d55f0d850e36/packages/integration_test/ios/integration_test/Sources/integration_test/IntegrationTestPlugin.m#L82) → `self.pluginRegistrar.viewController.view.window.windowScene.windows`

## Prerequisites 

* https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/104117",,
170293,"### Use case

Just like having a AppDelegate that subclass from FlutterAppDelegate, we should have a SceneDelegate that subclass from FlutterSceneDelegate in our new app template. 

We could relay the message calls from scene delegate to app delegate, and ask developers to only use AppDelegate. However, we lose the scene info during the relay for multi-scene apps. For example, if we simply relay `sceneDidEnterBackground` to `applicationDidEnterBackground`, we lose the info about which scene enters the background. 


### Proposal

Add SceneDelegate to the new project template. ",,
171809,"### Use case

I came across these functions in FlutterAppDelegate.mm: 

```
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication*)application shouldSaveApplicationState:(NSCoder*)coder {
  [coder encodeInt64:self.lastAppModificationTime forKey:kRestorationStateAppModificationKey];
  return YES;
}
```

These APIs are also deprecated, and we should check if they are still working after adopting SceneDelegate. 

Unlike other APIs, the new state restoration API seems to be a non-trivial change: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/restoring-your-app-s-state

CC @gaaclarke @vashworth 

### Proposal

1. Double check if the existing state restoration still works after adopting scene delegate
2. Migrate to SceneDelegate APIs",,
170178,"### Use case

After adopting SceneDelegate, several AppDelegate methods are not call anymore. But instead, corresponding SceneDelegate methods will be called. 


Verified not called on app delegate, but called on scene delegate: 

[- sceneWillEnterForeground:](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiscenedelegate/scenewillenterforeground(_:)?language=objc)
[- sceneDidBecomeActive:](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiscenedelegate/scenedidbecomeactive(_:)?language=objc)
[- sceneWillResignActive:](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiscenedelegate/scenewillresignactive(_:)?language=objc)
[- sceneDidEnterBackground:](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiscenedelegate/scenedidenterbackground(_:)?language=objc)


Unverified but possibly similar behavior as above: 

[- scene:willContinueUserActivityWithType:](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiscenedelegate/scene(_:willcontinueuseractivitywithtype:)?language=objc)
[- scene:continueUserActivity:](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiscenedelegate/scene(_:continue:)?language=objc)
[- scene:didFailToContinueUserActivityWithType:error:](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiscenedelegate/scene(_:didfailtocontinueuseractivitywithtype:error:)?language=objc)

[- stateRestorationActivityForScene:](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiscenedelegate/staterestorationactivity(for:)?language=objc)
[- scene:restoreInteractionStateWithUserActivity:](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiscenedelegate/scene(_:restoreinteractionstatewith:)?language=objc)
[- scene:didUpdateUserActivity:](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiscenedelegate/scene(_:didupdate:)?language=objc)

I suspect the above list will be similar behavior (unverified), because the pattern here seems to be that, as long as there's a similar function in SceneDelegate, then it will replace the corresponding function in AppDelegate. 

Also note these UIApplication notifications are still working: 

- didFinishLaunchingNotification
- didBecomeActiveNotification
- didEnterBackgroundNotification



### Proposal

We should migrate those methods over to scene delegate. 

Side note: app delegate could be deprecated in the future from some sources.

It occurs in first seconds of the user's session, and gets recorded in crashlytics.
Using  compileSdkVersion = 36 minSDKVersion = 29 targetSdkVersion = 36
It seems to be happening due to use of deprecated code in Android native.

*Prevent assertion error in HardwareKeyboard during app startup
Details:
Added a _keyboardStateInitialized flag to HardwareKeyboard.
The assertion in _assertEventIsRegular is now skipped until the keyboard state is initialized (after syncKeyboardState() runs).
This prevents assertion errors if key events are received before the keyboard state is fully synchronized, such as during app startup or hot reload.
Motivation:
Fixes an issue where key events during app loading could trigger an assertion failure, improving robustness during initialization.

174472,"### Steps to reproduce

1. Create a Flutter app with a snack bar theme, specifying a close icon color
2. Also add an icon button theme, with an icon color
3. Create a `SnackBar` widget, observe the close icon color being the icon button theme
4. Create a `SnackBar` widget and override `closeIconColor`, and observe the color being the icon button theme

### Expected results

In all cases the `closeIconColor` for the `SnackBar` widget should override any and all theme colors.

In my opinion also, the snack bar theme's `closeIconColor` should take precedent over the more generic icon button theme, but I could see a case for either way here.

### Actual results

The icon button theme color is used for the close icon color of the `SnackBar`, regardless of widget field overrides or snack bar theme.


### Code sample

<details open><summary>Code sample</summary>

See the `SnackBar` text for what I believe should be the actual behavior vs expected behavior.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() => runApp(const SnackBarDemo());

class SnackBarDemo extends StatelessWidget {
  const SnackBarDemo({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final light = ThemeData.light();

    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'SnackBar Demo',
      theme: light.copyWith(
        snackBarTheme: light.snackBarTheme.copyWith(
          showCloseIcon: true,
          closeIconColor: Colors.blue,
        ),
        iconButtonTheme: IconButtonThemeData(
          style: ButtonStyle(
            iconColor: WidgetStateColor.fromMap({
              WidgetState.any: Colors.purple,
            }),
          ),
        ),
      ),
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: const Text('SnackBar Demo')),
        body: const SnackBarPage(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class SnackBarPage extends StatelessWidget {
  const SnackBarPage({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Center(
      child: Row(
        mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
        children: [
          ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              final snackBar = SnackBar(
                content: const Text(
                  'Snackbar should be Colors.blue (theme), but is Colors.purple',
                ),
              );
              ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(snackBar);
            },
            child: const Text('Button 1'),
          ),
          ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: () {
              final snackBar = SnackBar(
                closeIconColor: Colors.green,
                content: const Text(
                  'Snackbar should be Colors.green (widget override), but is Colors.purple',
                ),
              );
              ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(snackBar);
            },
            child: const Text('Button 2'),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

1. Clone the [repo](https://github.com/RustamG/flutter_golden_tests). It has a sample golden test with an image that fails the test intentionally.
2. Launch iOS simulator
3. Run in the terminal `flutter test integration_test/E2Es`

### Expected results

The test process stops. I should not kill it manually.

### Actual results

The test process doesn't exit having the following output:
```

",,
174355,"### Steps to reproduce

Following this guide, but left out the first step, as not developing for engine:

https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#developing-for-flutter

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/flutter/flutter.git flutter_main
cd flutter_main
git remote rename origin upstream
.\bin\flutter doctor
```

### Actual results

The command fails with an error message:
```
Invoke-WebRequest : NoSuchKeyThe specified key does not exist.No such object:
flutter_infra_release/flutter/e69de29bb2d1d6434b8b29ae775ad8c2e48c5391/dart-sdk-windows-x64.zip
```

Interestingly the doctor command works on `beta` or `stable`. So I guess the issue is, that the engine is not available for commit `e69de29bb2d1d6434b8b29ae775ad8c2e48c5391`
The commit also does not exist: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/commit/e69de29bb2d1d6434b8b29ae775ad8c2e48c5391
Also not in the old engine repo: https://github.com/flutter/engine/commit/e69de29bb2d1d6434b8b29ae775ad8c2e48c5391

But this commit is mentioned here:
https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/9a459a4272fbd4bd26e5f58f988d9c220770bb84/engine/src/flutter/docs/monorepo/engine_binary_hashing.md?plain=1#L43

I suppose the engine is not build on every commit, but it should somehow work out of the box?

",,
173912,"### Steps to reproduce

When extending FormField if the builder returns a Sliver an exception is thrown by the framework. 

It's not clear what the cause is but removing the following from the FormField build method made the exception go away and produced the expected results.

Source: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/master/packages/flutter/lib/src/widgets/form.dart#L783
```dart
final Widget child = Semantics(
      validationResult: hasError
          ? SemanticsValidationResult.invalid
          : SemanticsValidationResult.valid,
      child: widget.builder(this),
    );

```

Error:
> The following assertion was thrown building MtgRadioGroupSliver<IMtgCardLegalityFormat>(state: _MtgRadioGroupStateSliver<IMtgCardLegalityFormat>#b279d):
> A RenderSemanticsAnnotations expected a child of type RenderBox but received a child of type RenderSliverList.
> 
> RenderObjects expect specific types of children because they coordinate with their children during layout and paint. For example, a RenderSliver cannot be the child of a RenderBox because a RenderSliver does not understand the RenderBox layout protocol.
> The RenderSemanticsAnnotations that expected a RenderBox child was created by: Semantics ← MtgRadioGroupFormField<IMtgCardLegalityFormat> ← SliverToBoxAdapter ← ShrinkWrappingViewport ← IgnorePointer-[GlobalKey#45e78] ← Semantics ← Listener ← _GestureSemantics ← 


Steps:

1. Create a custom FormField by extending FormField
2. In the builder method return a SliverList. 
3. See exception is thrown.


### Expected results

The form fields should not error out.

======== Exception caught by widgets library =======================================================
The following assertion was thrown building SliverFormField<Object>(dependencies: [UnmanagedRestorationScope, _FormScope], state: FormFieldState<Object>#5f240):
A RenderViewport expected a child of type RenderSliver but received a child of type RenderSemanticsAnnotations.

RenderObjects expect specific types of children because they coordinate with their children during layout and paint. For example, a RenderSliver cannot be the child of a RenderBox because a RenderSliver does not understand the RenderBox layout protocol.
The RenderViewport that expected a RenderSliver child was created by: Viewport ← IgnorePointer-[GlobalKey#bc1e6] ← Semantics ← Listener ← _GestureSemantics ← RawGestureDetector-[LabeledGlobalKey<RawGestureDetectorState>#ba216] ← Listener ← _ScrollableScope ← _ScrollSemantics-[GlobalKey#2a5f9] ← NotificationListener<ScrollMetricsNotification> ← RepaintBoundary ← CustomPaint-[GlobalKey#dbb9e] ← ⋯
The RenderSemanticsAnnotations that did not match the expected child type was created by: Semantics ← SliverFormField<Object> ← Viewport ← IgnorePointer-[GlobalKey#bc1e6] ← Semantics ← Listener ← _GestureSemantics ← RawGestureDetector-[LabeledGlobalKey<RawGestureDetectorState>#ba216] ← Listener ← _ScrollableScope ← _ScrollSemantics-[GlobalKey#2a5f9] ← NotificationListener<ScrollMetricsNotification> ← ⋯

======== Exception caught by widgets library =======================================================
The following assertion was thrown while finalizing the widget tree:
Duplicate GlobalKey detected in widget tree.

The following GlobalKey was specified multiple times in the widget tree. This will lead to parts of the widget tree being truncated unexpectedly, because the second time a key is seen, the previous instance is moved to the new location. The key was:
- [GlobalKey#bc1e6]
This was determined by noticing that after the widget with the above global key was moved out of its previous parent, that previous parent never updated during this frame, meaning that it either did not update at all or updated before the widget was moved, in either case implying that it still thinks that it should have a child with that global key.
The specific parent that did not update after having one or more children forcibly removed due to GlobalKey reparenting is:
- Semantics(container: false, properties: SemanticsProperties, renderObject: RenderSemanticsAnnotations#d7bc1 NEEDS-LAYOUT NEEDS-PAINT NEEDS-COMPOSITING-BITS-UPDATE DETACHED)
A GlobalKey can only be specified on one widget at a time in the widget tree.
When the exception was thrown, this was the stack: 
#0      BuildOwner.finalizeTree.<anonymous closure> (package:flutter/src/widgets/framework.dart:3354:15)
#1      BuildOwner.finalizeTree (package:flutter/src/widgets/framework.dart:3379:8)

174354,"### Steps to reproduce

The method GoogleSignIn.supportsAuthentication returns a bool indicating whether auth is supported.

On Linux (and presumably other non-supported platforms) an UnimplementedError is thrown from google_sigin_in_platform_interface.

```dart
class _PlaceholderImplementation extends GoogleSignInPlatform {
  @override
  Future<void> init(InitParameters params) {
    throw UnimplementedError();
  }

  @override
  Future<AuthenticationResults?> attemptLightweightAuthentication(
      AttemptLightweightAuthenticationParameters params) {
    throw UnimplementedError();
  }

  @override
  bool supportsAuthenticate() {
    throw UnimplementedError();
  }
```

Rather than throwing an error, supportsAuthentication should return false.


### Expected results

the method should return false.

### Actual results

the method throws:
UnimplementedError

174483,"After packaging the app as an MSIX executable for Windows, it crashes immediately during camera initialization using the camera_windows plugin. There are no error messages shown in the console or logs.

Upon checking Windows Event Viewer, I found that the crash is caused by a fault in the frameserver.dll module.

This issue does not occur when running the app in debug or release mode outside of MSIX.

Steps to reproduce:

Build and package the Flutter app with camera_windows as an MSIX.

Install and run the app.

App crashes during camera initialization.",,

clone packages folder from git use latest version 

replace  _adTagUrl  with this in main file 

  static const String _adTagUrl = true
      ? ""https://feeds.kwikmotion.com/v1/vmap""
      : 'https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?iu=/21775744923/external/vmap_ad_samples&sz=640x480&cust_params=sample_ar%3Dpremidpost&ciu_szs=300x250&gdfp_req=1&ad_rule=1&output=vmap&unviewed_position_start=1&env=vp&impl=s&cmsid=496&vid=short_onecue&correlator=';
or you can replace ad tag url with this ""https://feeds.kwikmotion.com/v1/vmap""

run app 
ads is not working 

trying first url 
ads works find 

i am using same content 

<img width=""977"" height=""387"" alt=""Image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4cbc48f6-72cb-46ef-be1b-baaae1b2deca"" />

### Expected results

vmap url should be work 

### Actual results

no ads displayed 
and i am using same this file content

",,
174474,"### Use case

**Description:**
Currently, `DefaultTabController` doesn’t provide a direct way to listen to tab changes.
If we want to know the current tab index, we have to use a `TabController` manually and add a listener, which removes the simplicity of using `DefaultTabController`.

It would be very useful if `DefaultTabController` exposed an `onChanged` callback that returns the current tab index whenever the user changes tabs.

**Expected behavior:**
When the user switches tabs (by tapping or swiping), the `onChanged` callback should be triggered with the updated index.

### Proposal

```
DefaultTabController(
  length: 3,
  onChanged: (index) {
    print('Current tab index: $index');
  },
  child: Scaffold(
    appBar: AppBar(
      bottom: TabBar(
        tabs: [
          Tab(text: 'Tab 1'),
          Tab(text: 'Tab 2'),
          Tab(text: 'Tab 3'),
        ],
      ),
    ),
    body: TabBarView(
      children: [
        Center(child: Text('Tab 1')),
        Center(child: Text('Tab 2')),
        Center(child: Text('Tab 3')),

",,
174439,"### Steps to reproduce

1. Create a blank flutter project with the latest stable flutter version (I tested only on windows)
2. set up go routing
3. add a shellroute to your router and add two routes in this shellroute
4. add a scaffold in the shellroutes builder.
5. navigate between routes in the same scaffold
### Expected results

The old page disappears before the new page appears in the page transition, this does not happen when transitioning routes in the same scaffold

### Actual results

The old page lingers in the background for about half a second when transitioning routes in the same scaffold.

166058,"### Steps to reproduce

Now in version 3.29.2, without any code changes, tapping on the DropdownMenu with the same parameters enableFilter = true and requestFocusOnTap = true does not allow typing in the TextField, you have to tap twice (i.e., the overlay opens and you have to tap again to search).

### Expected results

In Flutter version 3.27.1, the requestFocusOnTap parameter worked fine when tapping on the DropdownMenu widget. The overlay menu opened and the focus for typing was activated with enableFilter = true.

### Actual results

You have to double-click to search in the dropdown menu, it doesn't make sense

Implements computeDryBaseline method in RenderAligningShiftedBox to fix layout failures when DropdownButtonFormField is used inside Wrap inside AlertDialog. The method calculates baseline using dry layout methods and accounts for child positioning within the parent's coordinate space.

173270,"### Steps to reproduce

1. i crate a package to run ffprobe on Windows flutter
2. I tried running a simple command using `CreateProcessW`, but it crashes in debug mode without any error. In release mode, it runs perfectly.
3. I tested another executable, for example `java.exe`, and it still crashes.
4. The command runs correctly, but after some time it crashes without any error. The debugger connection is lost and the application window closes. In VS Code, only the debugger connection is lost, but the application window remains open.

### Expected results

Works without crashing.

### Actual results

It crashes in debug mode.

172544,"### Steps to reproduce

1. using   `local_auth: ^2.3.0`

I haven't been able to reproduce this error myself, not even in the iOS Simulator.

Unfortunately, I only have the user information:

FaceId is being queried multiple times. Sometimes it takes longer to load, sometimes more, sometimes less. The error appears to occur randomly.
For example, iOS 18.5 is being used.
At first, everything worked fine, and then a day later, it occurred. After a few loops the user is back in.

I found the following error message in the log:

PlatformException(NotAvailable, Authentication aborted., com.apple.LocalAuthentication, null)

### Expected results

FaceID should work directly without loops if the face is correct.

### Actual results

Users randomly end up in a loop where the Face ID is queried several times and sometimes the Face ID takes a very long time.

",,
173641,"Hi team,

Context

Codelab: https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/flutter-codelab-first#2

Using the same dev tools listed in the codelab.

Location

Part 3: “Replace the contents of this file with the following:”

Issue

The code errors because the referenced packages were not installed.

I did not explicitly download those packages earlier.

Steps to reproduce

Set up a fresh environment using the tools specified in the codelab.

Proceed to Part 3 and replace the file contents as shown.

Run the app → errors about missing packages.

Expectation

Either the example works with the default setup, or the required packages are listed earlier.

Suggestion

Add a step to install the required packages before Part 3, or note the prerequisites in that section.

If there is a way to include these by default during setup, a pointer would help.

Please let me know if these packages are expected to be present by default or if I missed an install step.",,
173029,"### Steps to reproduce

1. Create a `CustomScrollView` with a `SliverMainAxisGroup`
2. Add some child slivers that contain `GestureDetector`
3. Tap on the upper left corner of a child that's partially off screen
4. Check the details of the `onTapDown` callback

### Expected results

The `details.localPosition` in the top left corner should be relatively close to `Offset(0, 0)` (depending on how close you can tap/click).

### Actual results

The `details.localPosition` is not close to `Offset(0, 0)`.  

In the example below, when a box is just slightly on-screen, tapping the top left corner gives ~`Offset(0, 600)`

Notes:
- Tested on iOS and Web
- Only checked `onTapDown`

174262,"### Steps to reproduce

1. Run the code sample
2. Tap on the `0` item (the local and global `dx` values are equal, and this is correct, as the item is the leftmost)
3. Tap on the left side of the `1` or `2` item (the local and global `dx` values are equal, which is incorrect; the local `dx` value has to have a value near 0)

### Expected results

The local position of the gesture for each child of `SliverCrossAxisGroup` is correct.

### Actual results

The local position of the gesture for each child of `SliverCrossAxisGroup` is incorrect.

169495,"### Steps to reproduce

1. Have a page with a `WebViewWidget` from the package [webview_flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/webview_flutter)
2. Use `showCupertinoSheet` or push a `CupertinoSheetRoute` above this page

I've also tested with [flutter_inappwebview](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_inappwebview) and the behavior is the same, this makes me think that it might be an issue with PlatformViews in general.

### Expected results

The webview should perform the transition alongside the page it is attached to.

### Actual results

The webview looks ""detached"" from the rest of the page. Like it is stacked on top.

174261,"### Steps to reproduce

[`ListView.separated`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/ListView/ListView.separated.html) (as well as [`SliverList.separated`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/SliverList/SliverList.separated.html) accept [`findChildIndexCallback`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/SliverChildBuilderDelegate/findChildIndexCallback.html) parameter which can be used to preserve the state of its children when their position change. 

When this callback is implemented to return the actual item index (based on what's built by `itemBuilder`), the states aren't correctly preserved.

### Expected results

Indices returned by `findChildIndexCallback` should be treated as item indices to match indices passed to `itemBuilder`.

### Actual results

Indices returned by `findChildIndexCallback` are passed directly to `SliverChildBuilderDelegate` without taking the added separators into account. Currently, to achieve the desired behavior, indices returned by the callback need to be multiplied by 2.

### Code sample

In the following example ListView's items are reordered but their states aren't preserved: https://dartpad.dev/?id=13e666900223cef2b9d89ea8f925bad0

2. enter into a web page used plugin webview_flutter

### Expected results

Expect a clear web page

### Actual results

On some Android actual device, the web page used plugin webview_flutter may be unclear, the text in web is jagged, and rendering feels disconnected when sliding, like videos provide. 
I got the problem after upgrading flutter from 3.22.0 to 3.29.3. On flutter 3.22.0, had no problem.

172890,"### Steps to reproduce

- Create a new Flutter project: flutter create test_app
- Connect a physical device running iOS 26.0 (iOS 18 beta)
- Try to run: flutter run --release -d <device_id>
- Observe the UIApplicationMain symbol error

Device Information:

Device: iPhone 11 Pro
iOS Version: 26.0 23A5297m (iOS 18 beta)
Xcode: 16.4
macOS: 26.0 25A5316i
Additional Context: The Flutter documentation at https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/ios/ios-latest mentions that release and profile modes should work as temporary workarounds for iOS 26, but both modes are failing with the same UIApplicationMain symbol error.

### Expected results

Flutter apps should build and run successfully on iOS 26.0 devices, especially in release and profile modes as mentioned in the documentation.


### Actual results

What happened? Flutter apps fail to build and run on physical devices running iOS 26.0 (iOS 18 beta) with the error:

```
Error (Xcode): Undefined symbol: UIKit.UIApplicationMain(Swift.Int32, Swift.UnsafeMutablePointer<Swift.UnsafeMutablePointer<Swift.Int8>>?, Swift.String?, Swift.String?) -> Swift.Int32
Error (Xcode): Linker command failed with exit code 1
```

Actual behavior:

Debug mode: Fails (expected based on documentation)
Profile mode: Fails (unexpected - documentation says it should work)
Release mode: Fails (unexpected - documentation says it should work)
iOS Simulator: Works correctly in debug mode

139212,"### Is there an existing issue for this?

- [X] I have searched the [existing issues](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues)
- [X] I have read the [guide to filing a bug](https://flutter.dev/docs/resources/bug-reports)

### Use case

When running `flutter build ipa`, the `-allowProvisioningUpdates` flag is applied at the _export_ stage, but I think that it isn't being applied when building the initial archive.

I have a project set up for automatic signing, which fails a `flutter build ipa` because there's no signing certificate: ```
Error (Xcode): No signing certificate ""iOS Development"" found: No ""iOS Development"" signing certificate matching team ID
""23Z8894VWP"" with a private key was found.
/Users/sam/Developer/Projects/mono/client/club/ios/Runner.xcodeproj
```

It does not appear to attempt to repair/create the keys, which is what I would expect if the `-allowProvisioningUpdates` flag was supplied to xcode during the archiving phase.

If I perform a manual xcodebuild and supply that flag (and also an app store api key), it works: ```
    xcodebuild archive \
      -workspace ""client/$APP_NAME/ios/Runner.xcworkspace"" \
      -scheme Runner \
      -destination generic/platform=iOS \
      -archivePath ""$ARCHIVE_NAME"" \
      -allowProvisioningUpdates \
      -authenticationKeyID $AUTH_KEY \
      -authenticationKeyIssuerID $AUTH_ISSUER \
      -authenticationKeyPath ""~/.private_keys/AuthKey_$AUTH_KEY.p8""
```

It will correctly generate the developer cert/key. Running `flutter build ipa` will subsequently succeed.

I'm not sure that using the authKey is specifically necessary here - it would probably also work without it if the user had an up to date developer signing account signed in with Xcode. Being able to supply the key is useful though.

It would be great to be able to build this behaviour into flutter, particularly for use in CI environments.

### Proposal

Two changes:
- Extend `flutter build ipa` so that authentication key arguments can be passed through to xcode build
- Extend `flutter build ipa` so that the initial archive correctly uses the `-allowProvisioningUpdates` flag

The first would be useful regardless.

The second ought to be happening now, but I believe that there may be a hole in the logic of `buildXcodeProject` which is causing the flag not to be applied in my situation. Either that, or it's the fact that the auth key arguments are required in my case -- I haven't quite figured out which.",,

120049,"## Steps to Reproduce

1. Execute `flutter run` on the code sample
2. type some things in text field like Screenshots that are attached 
3. try to move the cursor on different words and goes to the last words and move the cursor to the last position

**Expected results:** we want the cursor to move to the last position without any problems 

**Actual results:** As indicated in the screenshots the cursor stuck before the last position and can't move it to last position of words

for an additional report, this problem occurs when using a Persian or Arabic keyboard for typing and we use a special font for our text this makes other bugs that this issue repeats for each line of text for the normal situation this just occurs on the last line of the paragraph. also if using Emojies this problem repeats again or for text selection, we can select the last character of words.

another issue that should be mentioned here is the cursor movement problem for Persian keyboards when characters stick together this makes a bug that the issue stuck in the wrong position and when u typing something these words display in another position that does not match with your selected position

<!--
      Please create a minimal reproducible sample that shows the problem
      and attach it below between the lines with the backticks.

      To create it you can use `flutter create bug` command and update the `main.dart` file.

      Alternatively, you can use https://dartpad.dev/
      which is capable of creating and running small Flutter apps.

      Without this we will unlikely be able to progress on the issue, and because of that
      we regretfully will have to close it.

67090,"Currently if you run `flutter drive -d chrome` (and likely `-d edge`) but without `--browser-name` we will run the web test and succeed. However, there are two issues with this:

- We already have a way to specify the browser when running driver tests `--browser-name=BROWSER`, so why is `-d chrome` allowed?
- When running with `-d chrome` you will see the browser opened once, closed immediately, then opened again. It's ultimately harmless but confusing. (hypothesis: the first browser is opened by Flutter tool's existing logic for launching browsers for `flutter run`, and the second browser is launched by WebDriver).

It is also possible to run with `--browser-name` but without `-d`, but that will attempt to run an Android test, which may produce false positives (you think your web test succeeded but you actually ran an Android test).

**Possible solution**: only use the `-d BROWSER` and make it consistent with `flutter run`. Bypass Flutter tool's browser launching logic and delegate to WebDriver.",,
174141,"### Steps to reproduce

1. Make sure `SemanticsBinding.instance.ensureSemantics()` is called
2. Run on web
3. Spam click the increment button
Note: It might be hard to reproduce, sometimes it happens, sometimes it doesn't, try pausing between click spams

### Expected results

There shouldn't be an error when clicked

### Actual results

It causes an error

Unable to reproduce on my own device, however I am getting a concerningly rapid increase in reports from my users that the UI isn't showing when they visit the app on Chrome. Other browsers work fine. I managed to get a call with one of them to inspect the logs:

The website is https://pro.joinoto.com

Link to the same issue discussed elsewhere - https://forum.itsallwidgets.com/t/flutter-web-rendering-and-chrome-update/3643

This is pretty critical for us (healthcare app) and results in a complete blank screen. 

### Expected results

The UI should load.

### Actual results

No UI - blank screen.

",,
172157,"I upgraded my Flutter project from Flutter 3.19 to Flutter 3.29 and updated the Gradle setup. After migration, Android builds are failing with multiple issues, whereas iOS builds work fine. 
What Happened After Migration
1. Initial build error:
`> A failure occurred while executing com.android.build.gradle.internal.tasks.MergeNativeLibsTask$MergeNativeLibsTaskWorkAction
   > 2 files found with path 'lib/arm64-v8a/libc++_shared.so' from inputs:
      - /Users/anupsma/.gradle/caches/8.10.2/transforms/6a71e5ba32995bc8ea0aafe7461f1ec2/transformed/jetified-flutter-7.0/jni/arm64-v8a/libc++_shared.so
      - /Users/anupsma/.gradle/caches/8.10.2/transforms/926f9a8f506ee4a29164429a9704b75e/transformed/jetified-pdfium-android-1.9.2/jni/arm64-v8a/libc++_shared.so`

Applied fix: added `packagingOptions`:
`android {
    // existing code

    packagingOptions {
        pickFirst 'lib/arm64-v8a/libc++_shared.so'
        pickFirst 'lib/x86_64/libc++_shared.so'
        pickFirst 'lib/x86/libc++_shared.so'
        pickFirst 'lib/armeabi-v7a/libc++_shared.so'
    }
}`

2. After that:

✅ Build succeeded
❌ App installed but got stuck at splash screen

Got Runtime errors:
`Unhandled Exception: PlatformException(channel-error, Unable to establish connection on channel: ""dev.flutter.pigeon.shared_preferences_android.SharedPreferencesApi.getAll""., null, null)`

same method channel error for Posthog plugin and Firebase_core

Environment:

- Flutter - 3.29.0
- Dart - 3.7.0
- Gradle - 8.5
- AGP - 8.2.1
- Kotlin - 2.0.0

`environment:
  sdk: "">=3.7.0 <4.0.0""

dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  firebase_core: ^3.4.0
  shared_preferences: ^2.5.2
  posthog_flutter: ^5.0.0
  # ...other dependencies
`
Questions
❓ What might be causing the method channel errors in Android after upgrading?
❓ Is there any known compatibility issue between Flutter 3.29, AGP 8.2.1, and JDK 17 for these plugins?
❓ How can I resolve the IllegalArgumentException in firebase_core compile task?
❓ Any recommended environment setups or fixes for these upgrade issues?

Additional Notes

- Project worked fine before the upgrade.
-Errors persist across all flavors.
-iOS build and run works fine.
-other projects are working fine (new projects)

Thank you in advance for your guidance


",,
160431,"### Steps to reproduce

1. Run example with `flutter run -d chrome`
2. Press tab to move focus to the topmost button
3. Move focus down with arrowDown key on your keyboard
Observe focus is moved down 1 row with each press, alternating between the fullwidth buttons and items in horizontal ListViews

4. Scroll down so neither top or bottom is visible
5. Move focus up or down with keys
Observe focus skips over items in the horizontal ListViews

### Expected results

Focus traversal behaves consistently when inside the same scrollable, no matter the scroll position

### Actual results

Focus traversal only enters nested scrollables when at start or end of the outer scollable

This pull request updates the usage of state sets in theme and widget property resolution logic throughout the codebase, replacing all instances of `MaterialState` with `WidgetState`. This change ensures consistency with the newer `WidgetState` API and prepares the code for future enhancements or compatibility. The update affects component themes, button styles, property generators, and related tests.

### Steps to reproduce

This is the same issue as closed https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/121210
When deferred loading is used, Flutter generates multiple js chunks, e.g. main.dart.js, main.dart.js_1.part.js, main.dart.js_2.part.js, ...
If browser has the previous versions of these chunks in the cache, it will just use them without fetching new versions from a server.
This issue can be workarounded by different ways, but the best one is to fix how part.js are loaded from main.dart.js by replacing 
**().createScriptURL(l+k) to ().createScriptURL(l+k+""?v=N.N.NN"")**
That change will enforce the browser to always load part.js files when a new version is deployed.
Currently possible workarounds:
1. Ask users to clear the browser cache manually when a new version of app is deployed - totally ""ugly"" and inconvenient.
2. Add cache control attributes on the hosting server, i.e. at least no-cache and etag, but that will force the browser to ask a server every time and get 304 responses in most of the cases - so slow down considering that usually there are hundreds of part.js files.
3. **There is an alternative solution instead of running bash script, see** https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/127459#issuecomment-2378870433
4. Currently after 'flutter build web' I'm using the following post-processing script to fix this caching problem, but actually Flutter has to have this functionality embedded:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Based on: https://github.com/doonfrs/flutter-build-web-cache-problem/blob/main/build-web.sh
# and https://www.reddit.com/r/FlutterDev/comments/1euenbd/avoiding_caching_issues_after_a_new_web_flutter/
#
# Run only ONCE after 'flutter build web' as: ./prepare.sh
# Expected folder structure:
#   build 
#     web
#   prepare.sh
#   pubspec.yaml

",,
174022,"### Steps to reproduce

When running a Flutter app on a real device running iOS 14, the app crashes in the Raster thread (io.flutter.1.raster).

The crash occurs when Flutter calls Metal to compile shaders, triggering a system malloc error:
malloc: free_list_checksum_botch abort() called
This indicates heap corruption during the Flutter engine's interaction with Metal.



### Expected results

Flutter should be able to reliably complete Metal shader compilation without causing the application to abort directly due to malloc heap corruption.

### Actual results

When calling Metal to compile a shader in the Flutter Raster thread, the malloc free_list_checksum_botch function is triggered, causing the app to crash.

171111,"Adds `IntrinsicBox` for #171060 

Using `IntrinsicWidth` will cause the column to expand until any text widgets can fit on one line. Using containers/boxes can prevent the text from expanding the column but also constrains the text if there are wider elements. `IntrinsicBox` can limit the intrinsic dimensions of its child but does not prevent it from fully utilizing the space if the size of the column turns out to be bigger.

162231,"### Steps to reproduce

Run attached code. You can also use any other scrollable widget, change any TextField properties, the result will be the same

### Expected results

A fully functional, expanded TextField inside a scrollable widget is expected. Any workarounds to achieve this setup would be greatly appreciated

### Actual results

Text selection unexpectedly jumps to the start, causing issues such as scrolling to the top of the TextField.

",,
173447,"### Steps to reproduce

Run the code below using `flutter run -d linux` and wait up to 15 minutes (usually a lot less, sometimes less than 10 seconds). All the code does is show a timer on the screen.

### Expected results

There should be a counter that increases forever.

### Actual results

The timer eventually just appears to hang.

In practice (as tested via debugger), the Dart part of the application is continuing to work fine. It's just the window that isn't updating.

### Code sample

```dart
import 'dart:async';

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(const MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatefulWidget {
  const MyApp({super.key});

  @override
  State<MyApp> createState() => _MyAppState();
}

class _MyAppState extends State<MyApp> {
  final DateTime _start = DateTime.now();
  
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    scheduleMicrotask(() { setState(() { /* rebuild */ }); });
    return Center(
      child: Text(
        '${DateTime.now().millisecondsSinceEpoch - _start.millisecondsSinceEpoch}ms',
        textDirection: TextDirection.ltr,
      ),

174475,"# Flutter Project Troubleshooting Report: `flappy_clone` and `flappy_deluxe`

**User:** Clint (via Android Studio Gemini Assistant)
**Date of Report:** August 26, 2024 (Based on chat progression)
**Assistant:** Gemini Large Language Model

## 1. Initial State & Problem Description (`flappy_clone`):
*   The troubleshooting session began with an existing Flutter project, referred to as `flappy_clone`.
*   The primary issue within `flappy_clone` was that Android Studio displayed **""Target of URI doesn't exist""** errors for core Flutter libraries, most notably `import 'package:flutter/material.dart';` and `import 'package:flutter/services.dart';`.
*   This prevented the IDE from recognizing basic Flutter widgets and services, making it impossible to run the application or effectively debug.
*   The project's `lib/main.dart` (and other files in `lib`) contained the game logic. It was implied that this project might also have older dependencies or potential null safety issues that the user was looking to resolve.
*   The initial `pubspec.yaml` for `flappy_clone` was examined, and several dependencies were identified as being used based on the import statements in the code.

## 2. Decision to Migrate to a New Project (`flappy_deluxe`):
*   Due to the persistent core library resolution errors in `flappy_clone`, and to ensure a clean project structure and configuration, a decision was made to create a brand new Flutter project named `flappy_deluxe`.
*   The intent was to migrate the `lib` folder (containing the application code) and assets from `flappy_clone` to `flappy_deluxe` to see if a fresh project setup would resolve the ""Target of URI doesn't exist"" errors.

## 3. Phase 1: New Project Setup (`flappy_deluxe`) and Code/Asset Integration:
*   A new Flutter project, `flappy_deluxe`, was created using standard Flutter tooling.
*   The entire `lib` folder from `flappy_clone` was copied into `flappy_deluxe`, replacing its default `lib` content.
*   Assets (images, sounds, fonts) from `flappy_clone` were intended to be copied over to a corresponding `assets` directory structure in `flappy_deluxe`.

## 4. Phase 2: `pubspec.yaml` Reconstruction & Dependency Management for `flappy_deluxe`:
*   **Dependency Identification:** Based on the import statements in the copied `lib/main.dart`, the following packages were identified as necessary for `flappy_deluxe`:
    *   `cupertino_icons`
    *   `url_launcher`
    *   `share_plus`
    *   `audioplayers`
    *   `google_fonts`
    *   `google_mobile_ads`
    *   `games_services`
    *   `vector_math`
*   **`pubspec.yaml` Modification for `flappy_deluxe`:**
    *   The `dependencies` section was populated with these packages, using common recent versions.
    *   `flutter_lints` was added to `dev_dependencies`.
    *   The `flutter:` section was updated to include asset declarations, eventually listing each asset file (`.png`, `.wav`) individually.
    *   The custom font `Bangers` was also declared.
*   `flutter pub get` was run after `pubspec.yaml` modifications.

## 5. Phase 3: Persistent ""Target of URI doesn't exist"" Error in `flappy_deluxe`:
*   **Critical Finding:** Despite the fresh project setup and correctly configured `pubspec.yaml` (with `flutter pub get` running successfully for external packages), the **""Target of URI doesn't exist""** error for `import 'package:flutter/material.dart';` (and other core Flutter libraries) **reappeared in the new `flappy_deluxe` project.**
*   This indicated that the problem was likely not due to a corrupted project configuration in `flappy_clone` itself, but rather pointed towards a more fundamental issue with the Flutter SDK installation, Android Studio's configuration, or the Flutter/Dart plugins.

## 6. Phase 4: Environment Diagnostics and IDE Troubleshooting (Focus on `flappy_deluxe` as the testbed):
*   **Troubleshooting Steps for Core Library Resolution in `flappy_deluxe`:**
    *   **Confirmation of `flutter pub get`:** Verified successful execution.
    *   **IDE Cache Invalidation:** Performed ""File > Invalidate Caches / Restart..."" in Android Studio multiple times.
    *   **Flutter SDK Path Verification:** Confirmed the Flutter SDK path in Android Studio settings was correct (`C:\Users\clint\flutter`).
    *   **Project File Deletion (for `flappy_deluxe`):**
        *   Closed the project, deleted the `.idea` folder and `.iml` files, re-opened, and ran `flutter pub get`.
    *   **Flutter Clean:** Ran `flutter clean` followed by `flutter pub get`.
*   **`flutter doctor -v` Execution:**
    *   `flutter doctor -v` was run from `flappy_deluxe`'s terminal.
    *   **Output Summary:** Reported ""**No issues found!**"" for most categories (Flutter SDK, Windows, Android toolchain, etc.).
    *   **Key Anomaly:** The Android Studio section (version **2025.1.2**) indicated:
        *   `• Flutter plugin can be installed from: ...`
        *   `• Dart plugin can be installed from: ...`
        This suggested that `flutter doctor` did not detect the plugins as actively installed/recognized for this Android Studio version.
*   **Android Studio Plugin Check:**
    *   Based on the `flutter doctor` output, it was recommended to check **File > Settings... > Plugins** in Android Studio.
    *   The advice was to ensure ""Flutter"" and ""Dart"" plugins were installed and enabled, and to try reinstalling them if they were already present but potentially problematic. This was the last active troubleshooting step.

## 7. Current Status:
The primary unresolved issue is the Android Studio IDE's inability to resolve core Flutter library URIs (e.g., `package:flutter/material.dart`), displaying a **""Target of URI doesn't exist""** error. This problem was present in the original `flappy_clone` project and persisted even after migrating the code to a newly created project (`flappy_deluxe`) with a fresh `pubspec.yaml`. The `flutter doctor -v` output, while mostly clean, suggests a potential issue with the Flutter/Dart plugin recognition or installation within the user's specific Android Studio version (**2025.1.2**).

164621,"### Steps to reproduce


1. Generate code for sample class below
2. Dart analyze will show ""The '!' will have no effect because the receiver can't be null.""

This also happens in 2.8.2:

### Expected results

Generated code does not show a warning in dart analyzer.

Code emitted should be int.parse(state.pathParameters['id']!) because the parameter is not nullable.

### Actual results

Generated code is ""int.parse()!"", but parse() can never be null. 

So dart correctly generates this warning:
The '!' will have no effect because the receiver can't be null.
Try removing the '!' operator.

```dart
extension $MyRouteExtension on MyRoute {
  static MyRoute _fromState(GoRouterState state) =>
      MyRoute(int.parse(state.pathParameters['id']!)!);

  String get location => GoRouteData.$location(
    '/product/${Uri.encodeComponent(id.toString())}',
  );

  void go(BuildContext context) => context.go(location);

  Future<T?> push<T>(BuildContext context) => context.push<T>(location);

  void pushReplacement(BuildContext context) =>
      context.pushReplacement(location);

  void replace(BuildContext context) => context.replace(location);
}
```

174286,"## Description 📝

This PR updates the documentation for the transformHitTests parameter in the Transform widget to resolve ambiguity in the API documentation that has caused hit testing issues for developers.

The current documentation simply states ""Whether to apply the transformation when performing hit tests"" which is ambiguous. As seen in issues like #27587, developers expect transformed widgets to receive touch events across their entire visual area, but hits only register within the parent's original bounds. 

**The core issue**:  The documentation lacks clarity on:
❌ Hit test coordinate system transformation vs. hit test bounds expansion
🔄 Parent widget bounds as the constraint for hit test registration
⚠️ The distinction between visual rendering bounds and interactive bounds

### Before (Current Documentation) 

*Current documentation is vague: ""Whether to apply the transformation when performing hit tests""*

<img width=""1887"" height=""483"" alt=""Screenshot 2025-08-22 214745"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/24569be5-8dbe-4a02-8851-1546b8ac109e"" />

### After (Improved Documentation) 
<img width=""1091"" height=""293"" alt=""Screenshot 2025-08-22 214808"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f8504134-eba7-43ea-a71f-d9a8740ff295"" />

*New documentation clearly explains behavior, limitations, and solutions*

**Changes made:** ✅
- 🔧 Clarified that `transformHitTests` transforms registered hits into the child's resulting coordinate system
- 🚨 Explicitly documented the critical limitation: only hits within parent bounds can be registered
- 📚 Explained the behavior difference between `true` and `false` settings with concrete examples of transformation types
- 💡 Added guidance for common workarounds: expanding parent bounds or using Overlay for out-of-bounds elements

## Issues Fixed 🐛

Fixes #78120

**Related issues that motivated this change:** 🔗
- #27587 - Developers confused why GestureDetector doesn't respond after Transform
-  Multiple developers reported spending significant time debugging this behavior
-  Common misconception that visual transformation expands the hit test area

**Note**: This PR is test-exempt as it only updates documentation comments without changing any functionality.

173162,"### Steps to reproduce

## Problem Description

When a `ColorFilter` is applied to a `DecorationImage`, it fails to respect the image's EXIF orientation metadata. This causes images, such as photos taken on mobile phones, to be rendered incorrectly (e.g., rotated sideways).

This behavior is inconsistent with the `Image` widget (and by extension, popular third-party widgets like `CachedNetworkImage`), which displays the exact same image with the correct orientation, even when wrapped in a `ColorFiltered` widget.

This inconsistency forces developers to use more complex widget structures (like stacking an `Image` widget behind content) instead of the more direct and performant `DecorationImage`, just to apply a simple color effect like an overlay.

The root cause seems to be that the rendering pipeline triggered when a `ColorFilter` is present on a `DecorationImage` does not include the logic to read and apply the EXIF orientation metadata before painting the image.

## Steps to Reproduce

Here is a minimal, complete code sample that demonstrates the issue using the `cached_network_image` package and a real-world image URL known to contain EXIF rotation data.

**1. Add dependency to `pubspec.yaml`:**
```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  cached_network_image: ^3.3.1



### Expected results


Both images should be displayed in their correct, upright orientation. The DecorationImage should apply the color filter without altering the correct orientation of the image.


### Actual results

The CachedNetworkImage widget displays the image correctly (upright).

The Container with DecorationImage and an applied ColorFilter displays the image incorrectly (rotated or upside down), ignoring the EXIF data.

174348,"### Use case

I’ve noticed that when developing with two_dimensional_scrollables, the business scenarios are often quite complex.
Because of this, some exceptional cases are hard to catch during testing, which makes certain errors in production difficult to locate and reproduce.

Most of these issues seem to occur in the code after the assert statements in table.dart, and they often result in the entire TableView rendering as blank.
This makes it difficult to debug and creates a poor user experience when unexpected situations arise.

Alternative solutions considered:

Adding more defensive checks in my own code. However, this still does not prevent the TableView from failing completely if an unexpected null or invalid state occurs inside the plugin.

I haven’t found another package on pub.dev that provides the same functionality while being more fault-tolerant.

### Proposal

It would be helpful if two_dimensional_scrollables could:

Reduce the number of strict value requirements enforced by assert.

Provide reasonable default values in scenarios where a value may be missing or invalid, so that the widget can degrade gracefully instead of rendering as a blank screen.

This approach could improve stability in edge cases, make debugging easier, and ensure the TableView remains functional even when unexpected inputs occur.

Example idea:
Instead of asserting on a missing value, provide a fallback (e.g., an empty cell, default size, or a placeholder widget) so that the table still renders, and log a warning instead of throwing.",,
174052,"### Use case


`InteractiveViewer` has boundary logic baked in, which makes it inflexible and blocks important features. The current approach forces clamping inside constraints, with no way for users to define custom boundary behavior. 

* [[#57698](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/57698)](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/57698): Rotation requires complex, fragile math that attempt to fit the content into the boundary box. Most common use cases don't want rotated content to be box-clamped.
* [[#58042](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/58042)](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/58042): Overscroll/overpanning cannot be implemented with the current API because correction is applied immediately and hardcoded into the transform pipeline
* [[#145725](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/145725)](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/145725): Users cannot implement standard photo-viewer behavior, where panning is constrained to the child/image rect instead of the widget constraints. 

### Proposal

Introduce a lower-level widget (e.g. `RawInteractiveViewer` or `UnconstrainedInteractiveViewer`) that:

* Handles gesture detection and transform math.
* Does **not** enforce boundaries.
* Expose the raw transform before boundary correction, so users can implement their own policy (e.g. clamp to parent, clamp to child rect, allow overscroll, soft bounce-back, etc.). This goes beyond TransformationController, which only exposes the post-corrected transform.

`InteractiveViewer` could then be built on top of this with the current “clamp to constraints” behavior to avoid breaking changes.",,

",,
174356,"### Use case

We are building a real-time multiplayer game that uses Rive animations with audio event synchronization. When players perform actions remotely, the game continues running in the background, and animations must maintain their timeline to ensure audio plays at the correct positions. However, when the app window is hidden (e.g., minimized, covered by other windows, or in mission control on macOS), frame rendering stops, causing animations to freeze and audio to not play.


### Proposal

#### Proposed Solution
Add a `forceFramesEnabled` property to `SchedulerBinding` that allows developers to explicitly opt-in to continuous frame rendering when the app is hidden. This would be particularly useful for:

- Real-time games that continue running in the background
- Applications with animation-driven audio (like Rive)
- Multiplayer applications where game logic continues server-side

I have already implemented this feature in PR #173862.

#### Current Workaround
We've implemented a hacky solution by intercepting the `AppLifecycleState.hidden` state and replacing it with `AppLifecycleState.inactive` in a custom `DesktopWidgetsFlutterBinding`:

```dart
@override
void handleAppLifecycleStateChanged(AppLifecycleState state) {
  if (state == AppLifecycleState.hidden) {
    _isHidden = true;
    super.handleAppLifecycleStateChanged(AppLifecycleState.inactive);
  } else {
    if (state == AppLifecycleState.resumed) {
      _isHidden = false;
    }
    super.handleAppLifecycleStateChanged(state);
  }
}

First numbers are hidden behind the CupertinoNavigationBar. It's because the rendered size is different from the preferred size which doesn't include the large title height.

Coding agents are becoming popular. Flutter has good support for them via our MCP server. It might be really helpful for folks to have their coding agents configured for Flutter really easily.

### Proposal

A couple of ideas come to mind:

* when you install Flutter, we look to see what coding agents you have, and configure them to use Flutter (MCP server, rules files)
* add a `flutter install-mcp` command that does the above, but needs to be triggered by the human
* teach flutter doctor about coding agents, so it can tell you if you have one but it's not configured (see other issue)
* after `flutter pub upgrade` or equivalent is run, generate out a rules file that teaches my coding agent to USE ONLY THESE VERSIONS OF THESE LIBRARIES and here's the link to their API docs or link to the source files on disk. The idea for this one is to teach our coding agents to look only at my project's dependencies and not rely only on their global model knowledge.",,
174068,"### Use case

Flutter currently does not support Luxembourgish (lb) as a built-in localization option. This makes it harder to offer native-language UI experiences to users in Luxembourg. I'm not aware of any existing package that provides full translations for Material, Cupertino and Widget components. Manual localization may be possible, but is inconsistent and doesn't scale well.

### Proposal

As a native speaker with experience in translating English interface messages to Luxembourgish, I've translated the Material, Cupertino and Widget .arb files to Luxembourgish and attached them as .txt files to this issue.

[cupertino_lb.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/21867094/cupertino_lb.txt)
[material_lb.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/21867095/material_lb.txt)
[widgets_lb.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/21867093/widgets_lb.txt)",,
174082,"### Steps to reproduce

1. Extend MenuController()

As noted in https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/167806#issuecomment-3195572618:

> Making the MenuController final just broke our code, we were extending the MenuController to add some animation functionality. Was this breaking change really intended?

### Expected results

MenuController should be extensible.

### Actual results

MenuController is not extensible because MenuController is final. An [invalid_use_of_type_outside_library](https://dart.dev/diagnostics/invalid_use_of_type_outside_library) **error** is shown.

### Code sample

### Steps to reproduce

1.  Create a Flutter app using go_router.
2.  Configure AndroidManifest.xml with an <intent-filter> to handle https deep links (e.g., https://example.com).
3.  Launch the app from a cold start (app not running) with a deep link that has no explicit path:

```
adb shell 'am start -a android.intent.action.VIEW -c android.intent.category.BROWSABLE -d ""https://example.com""' com.example.android_issue_sample
```

### Expected results

- The deep link https://example.com should be normalized to https://example.com/,
preserving the scheme (https) and authority (example.com).
- Router should correctly recognize this as a deep link and route accordingly.

### Actual results

- The URI is converted to /?, losing the scheme and host.
- go_router treats this as a relative route rather than the full deep link.
- Example log output:
```
redirect: /?
```
instead of
```
redirect: https://example.com/
```

      GoRoute(
        path: '/',
        builder: (_, __) => const HomePage(),
      ),
    ],
    redirect: (context, state) {
      print('redirect: ${state.uri}');
      return null;
    },
  );

  runApp(MyApp(router: router));
}

  @override

    return const Scaffold(
      body: Center(child: Text('Home')),
    );

```

```xml

",,
174339,"### Steps to reproduce

As can be seen in the [go_router_builder relative route example](https://github.com/flutter/packages/blob/main/packages/go_router_builder/example/lib/go_relative.g.dart), there is unnecessary whitespace in the generated output of `RelativeGoRouteData`.

### Expected results

The generated output of a `RelativeGoRouteData` should be consistent with the whitespace of other route types.",,

4. Scroll up, list breaks, doesn't show all elements

The example issue is similar to [#59819](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/59819) but on `SliverMainAxisGroup`.

### Expected results

The items display is consistent during the scroll.

### Actual results

The scroll position is not consistent.

174445,"### Use case

The current package for cupertino on pub.dev says ""a better implementation of Apple design interface"".

### Proposal

For now, we can replace the contents of the README and thus the contents of https://pub.dev/packages/cupertino with ""This is planned to be the package for the cupertino library, after it is decoupled from the core Flutter framework. There is nothing here right now. Stay tuned!"" (or similar)",,

170929,"## Summary

Fixes a null check operator assertion error in TreeSliver that occurs during rapid expand/collapse operations.

## Problem

When rapidly toggling TreeSliver nodes (e.g., double-clicking), the paint method attempts to access `_animationLeadingIndices[parentIndex]\!` without checking if the key exists in the map. This causes a null check operator error because `parentIndex` might not be present in the animation indices map.

## Root Cause

In `RenderTreeSliver.paint()` at line 399, the code assumes that `_animationLeadingIndices[parentIndex]` always exists:

```dart
final UniqueKey key = _animationLeadingIndices[parentIndex]\!;
```

However, `parentIndex` is calculated as `math.max(segment.leadingIndex - 1, 0)` and may not be an actual animation index, causing the null check operator to fail.

## Solution

- Changed the access pattern to use the null-aware operator with a fallback
- When no animation key exists for the parent index, create a new UniqueKey
- This follows the comment's indication that there might be ""odd man out segments""

**Before:**
```dart
final UniqueKey key = _animationLeadingIndices[parentIndex]\!;
```

**After:**
```dart
final UniqueKey key = _animationLeadingIndices[parentIndex] ?? UniqueKey();
```

## Test Plan

- [x] All existing TreeSliver tests pass (21 tests)
- [x] Added new test for rapid toggle operations that reproduces the issue
- [x] Static analysis passes
- [x] Manually verified the fix resolves the crash in the reproduction case

## Breaking Changes

None - this is a bug fix that prevents crashes during normal usage.

174056,"When creating a [PR](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/173987) that I planned on cherrypicking into beta and stable, I added the `cp: beta` and `cp: stable` labels immediately when creating the PR thinking it would trigger CP PRs to be generated when the PR landed on `main`. However, it appears these labels are ignored if the PR is not already merged and the CP infrastructure won't automatically create the CP PRs until the PR is merged and the labels are removed and reapplied.

To avoid this, the automated CP workflow should either be updated to check for the `cp: *` labels when a PR is merged or it should remove the labels if they're added before a PR is merged and leave a comment stating that the labels can only be added after the PR lands.",,
173155,"This PR introduces mdformat as the chosen markdown formatting tool for Flutter.

## Tool Selection: mdformat

**Why mdformat:**
- Most popular Python-based markdown formatter (28k+ GitHub stars)
- Follows CommonMark specification strictly
- Highly configurable via .toml files
- Fast and lightweight
- Used by major projects across the Python ecosystem

## Configuration (.mdformat.toml)

- wrap = 80: Matches Flutter's existing code style guidelines
- number = false: Preserves author intent for ordered list numbering
- end_of_line = 'lf': Consistent with Flutter's Unix-style line endings

## Demonstration

Formatted 5 sample files to show consistent improvements:
- README.md: Improved line wrapping and spacing
- CONTRIBUTING.md: Consistent formatting throughout
- docs/contributing/Design-Documents.md: Better readability
- packages/flutter/README.md: Standardized formatting

## Next Steps (Future PRs)
- Step 2: Update CIPD and local tooling integration
- Step 3: Format all files + add non-blocking test
- Step 4: Make formatting test blocking

",,
174400,"## Problem
The Flutter widgets library provides the [AppLifecycleListener](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/AppLifecycleListener-class.html) so that applications can listen to changes in its state. These states are “resumed”, “inactive”, “hidden”, “paused”, and ""detached"". 
* Detached - The application is still hosted by a Flutter engine but is detached from any host views. When the application is in this state, the engine is running without a view.
* Resumed - this corresponds to the app running in the foreground active state.
* Inactive - At least one view of the application is visible, but none have input focus. The application is otherwise running normally. This state corresponds to the Flutter host view running in the foreground inactive state. Apps transition to this state when: in a phone call, responding to a TouchID request, entering the app switcher or the control center, or the UIViewController hosting the Flutter app is transitioning.
* Hidden - All views of an application are hidden, either because the application is about to be paused
* Paused - The application is not currently visible to the user, and not responding to user input.

Currently, Flutter uses lifecycle events/notifications from the FlutterAppDelegate and FlutterViewController to determine the state and send it to the framework.

## Proposal 1 - AppLifecycleState is per FlutterViewController/FlutterEngine
If the AppLifecycleState is per FlutterViewController/FlutterEngine, it should be determined by view events and scene events.

For example, let’s say an app has 2 scenes, each with a FlutterEngine/FlutterViewController. Under this proposal, if Scene 1 is backgrounded, you’d expect the state of the FlutterEngine in Scene 1 to be “paused” and the state of the FlutterEngine in Scene 2 to be “resumed”. With our current setup, both would be “resumed”.

The following events would need to be replaced:
* applicationBecameActive → sceneDidBecomeActive
* applicationWillResignActive → sceneWillResignActive
* applicationWillTerminate → sceneDidDisconnect
* applicationDidEnterBackground → sceneDidEnterBackground
* applicationWillEnterForeground → sceneWillEnterForeground

Pros:
* Essentially AppLifecycleState would act more as if it was “EngineLifecycleState” or “SceneLifecycleState”
* Less complex to implement

Cons:
* Not inline with the future of multi-view (see “Multi-View Consideration” below).
* May require changes in future if multi-view is adopted

## Proposal 2 - AppLifecycleState is per Application
According to [the documentation in app_lifecycle_state.h](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/39b4951f8f0bb7a32532ee2f67e83a783b065b58/engine/src/flutter/shell/platform/common/app_lifecycle_state.h#L32), these states should each be implemented with the whole application in mind rather than per-view. Each state should take into account multiple views in the following way:
* Resumed: when any view is shown
* Inactive: when all views are inactive
* Hidden: when all views are hidden 
* Paused: not view specific
* Detached: not view specific

Source:  [Flutter Multi-Window API (PUBLICLY SHARED)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eQG-IS7r4_S9_h50MY_hSGwUVtgSTRSLzu7MLzPNd2Y/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.o7x2v0daf5mw)

To make this happen, we’d probably introduce an internal-only ViewLifecycleState. This would track the state of the FlutterViewController and would be saved to the FlutterEngine. Then when a lifecycle event occurs, we’d get the ViewLifecycleState for each FlutterViewController in each FlutterEngine to determine the AppLifecycleState.

To access other FlutterViewControllers and FlutterEngines, we can [iterate through the Scenes](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiapplication/connectedscenes?language=objc) and iterate through each FlutterEngine they have connected (see Proposal 1of “Plugin lifecycle events”).

Pros:
* Inline with multi-view future
Cons:
* No way to track “SceneLifecycleState”",,

",,
159814,"This is a follow-up for the original issue [here](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/158961)

On iOS 18.2 the web view's gesture recognizer likely cached the old state of our `FlutterDelayingGestureRecognizer` (see PR description [here](https://github.com/flutter/engine/pull/56804)). 

The current workaround doesn't address a problem where a platform view receives the gesture even when it shouldn't have. (See [discussion here](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/158961#issuecomment-2518741174))

Also this is potentially a bug on iOS, so we may wanna create a reproducible project in UIKit and file the radar with Apple. ",,
173638,"This is because, when we make a release build (`recipes/release/release_builder.py`), the release builder (not Cocoon), invokes an engine build, and it does not set `content_hash`. We could have `engine_v2/{engine_v2.py|builder.py}` do this instead, but there isn't really a strong reason to do it that way.

This is blocking `3.36` so marked as a P0.

",,
173991,"### Use case

Modern Android projects are increasingly using Kotlin DSL for Gradle scripts, which provides better type safety, IDE support, and a more modern syntax. Migrating Flutter's Gradle files to Kotlin DSL would align with current Android development practices and improve the developer experience.

### Proposal

As of 2025-08-19, Flutter has still following gradle-based template files:

```
$ git ls-files | grep -E gradle.tmpl$
packages/flutter_tools/gradle/settings_aar.gradle.tmpl
packages/flutter_tools/templates/module/android/deferred_component/build.gradle.tmpl
packages/flutter_tools/templates/module/android/gradle/build.gradle.tmpl
packages/flutter_tools/templates/module/android/gradle/settings.gradle.tmpl
packages/flutter_tools/templates/module/android/host_app_common/app.tmpl/build.gradle.tmpl
packages/flutter_tools/templates/module/android/host_app_ephemeral/settings.gradle.tmpl
packages/flutter_tools/templates/module/android/library_new_embedding/Flutter.tmpl/build.gradle.tmpl
packages/flutter_tools/templates/plugin/android-java.tmpl/build.gradle.tmpl
packages/flutter_tools/templates/plugin/android-kotlin.tmpl/build.gradle.tmpl
packages/flutter_tools/templates/plugin/android.tmpl/settings.gradle.tmpl
packages/flutter_tools/templates/plugin_ffi/android.tmpl/build.gradle.tmpl
packages/flutter_tools/templates/plugin_shared/android.tmpl/settings.gradle.tmpl
```

The goal of this ticket is to migrate these files to use Kotlin DSL instead of Groovy-based Gradle scripts. Since these Gradle files are only used as templates for newly created projects, there should be no backward compatibility concerns. Existing projects will not be affected after flutter create is called.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Start a headless flutter engine
2. Call `getEnrolledBiometrics`
3. Throws Nullpointer when accessing Activity

### Expected results

Returns some error code so that we can handle the error in case it's a headless flutter engine

### Actual results

```

My current understanding of the issue is that we are never pushing a new empty frame for this layer, so the texture gets stuck as shown in the bug. If we keep track of when we had content last frame, and don't in the current frame, we can push a single empty frame for that layer when needed.

See example in https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/173635#issuecomment-3192787040

- [X] I have searched the [existing issues](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues)
- [X] I have read the [guide to filing a bug](https://flutter.dev/docs/resources/bug-reports)

### Steps to reproduce

Turn on TalkBack
Open the dropdown menu
Swipe through the accessible elements
Note they are not limited to the items in the list, and even include completely obscured elements

### Expected results

When you expand the dropdown menu, accessibility focus should be limited to just the items in that menu, allowing screen readers to select from the list without interference from other elements on the screen.

In the code below, the ""hello"" text should not receive accessibility focus while the menu is expanded.

### Actual results

The items in the list are shown and added to the accessibility tree, but all other nodes remain. Typically we use the BlockSemantics widget to hide elements that are drawn before objects like this.

The ""hello"" text is highlighted by TalkBack.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run the code sample
2. Scroll to the edges of the page

### Expected results

Scroll without any flicker

### Actual results

Flickering when the scrolling reaches the page limit


**Findings:**
During my investigation, I have noticed a few things.

1. It only starts to happen if it has more than 1 blur widget.
2. If I add a SafeArea, the flicker stops

### Steps to reproduce

- Create an app with e.g. go router and WebView
- Create an input view in the WebView
- Navigate away
- Connect a mouse e.g. via BlueTooth wired should work with an adapter too
- Move the cursor, the cursor changes to the I beam when you are in the area of the input field
- When you click on the invisible input field the keyboard pops up
- When you enter something the key presses will be forwarded to the WebView

### Expected results

Basically nothing, the WebView should not interference when it is not most top.

### Actual results

You can control the invisible WebView.

<img width=""1384"" height=""30"" alt=""Image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5da828ce-dc7f-49c8-b17b-27057dd84a83"" />",,
173024,"### Steps to reproduce

1. Create a Flutter project and replace the content of main.dart with the sample code provided above.
2. Run the app on a physical or virtual device.
3. Tap on the TextField at the bottom of the screen to bring up the keyboard.
4. Observe that the keyboard overlaps the TextField and the layout does not shift upward, even though resizeToAvoidBottomInset is set to true.

### Expected results

- The keyboard should push the bottom TextField up to keep it visible.
- InteractiveViewer should respect the keyboard insets or allow us to handle them manually.

### Actual results

- The TextField at the bottom gets hidden behind the keyboard when focused.
- Even though resizeToAvoidBottomInset is set to true, no layout shift happens.

### Code sample

""We are experiencing a critical issue where pub.dev is serving incorrect package content for flutter_foreground_task version 9.1.0.""
""Initially, this was observed in Dubai, UAE. The downloaded flutter_foreground_task-9.1.0.tar.gz has an SHA-256 hash of 9F1B25A81DB95D7119D2C5CFFC654048CBDD49D4056183E1BEADC1A6A38F3E29.""
""This hash corresponds to code from an older version (appears to be v3.10.0 or similar), not v9.1.0, leading to API mismatches (e.g., missing printDevLog in init).""
""Crucially, a friend in the UK has also downloaded the package from pub.dev today ([8/12/2025]) and sent the file to me, and when I checked the SHA-256 hash it is the exact same incorrect SHA-256 hash: 9F1B25A81DB95D7119D2C5CFFC654048CBDD49D4056183E1BEADC1A6A38F3E29.""
""The expected SHA-256 hash for the correct v9.1.0 (verified by other developers in different regions previously, or by checking older, correctly cached versions if available) is F15A8501865048A092829281A18277C0879007808269A94018698991738D1847.""
""This indicates a widespread problem with the distribution of flutter_foreground_task v9.1.0 on pub.dev, potentially affecting multiple regions or even being a global issue with the uploaded package itself.""

Publishers with linear audio ads will often continue audio ad playback when users background the app. Audio ad background is currently supported by native IMA SDK on Android and iOS (via a dedicated IMA SDK flag).

### Proposal

interactive_media_ads package to support background audio ad playback on both Android & iOS platforms. For iOS, IMASettings will need to expose the [enabledBackgroundPlayback](https://developers.google.com/interactive-media-ads/docs/sdks/ios/client-side/reference/Classes/IMASettings#enablebackgroundplayback) flag.

159680,"### Steps to reproduce

Create a page containing two nested widgets that can be scrollable. E.g. a SingleChildScrollView containing a TextField, or TabView containing a SingleChildScrollView. The nested Widget does not have to  be actually scrollable. E.g. it could be a single line TextField or a ListView using NeverScrollPhysics and the issue would still occur.

Enable the Semantics tree.

Run the app in a browser.

Scroll the outer widget.

### Expected results

The outer scrollable Widget should smoothly scroll from top to bottom.

### Actual results

When scrolling over the nested Widget, the scroll offset suddenly jumps to a new position, skipping a substantial amount of the scrollable area.

If the semantics tree is disabled, scrolling works as expected. Surprisingly the jumps also occur even if the nested widget is not actually scrollable. For example a TextField with a fixed amount of lines will also trigger the jumping behaviour wehen scrolling over it.

The same issue was also encountered for a TabView with a nested SingleChildScrollView and a SingleChildScrollView containing a ListView (event when setting scrollPhysics to NeverScrollPhysics).

### Code sample

150387,"In older versions of CameraX, concurrent displaying of the preview and video capture in conjunction with  image streaming and/or image capture had limited availability based on the camera level of the devices (at the time of writing, this can be seen in https://developer.android.com/media/camera/camerax/architecture#combine-use-cases). Because of this, `camera_android_camerax` introduced logic to avoid use of unsupported concurrent use cases (see https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/144414). However in recent changes to the CameraX library, a shared stream feature was introduced to allow these concurrent use cases despite device capabilities.

Thus, we should test removing the logic blocking the use of certain camera use case combinations based on device capabilities and remove it if possible to allow wider access to these concurrent camera usages.

See the release notes for more info on the shared stream feature:
- https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/camera#1.3.0-alpha04
- https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/camera#1.3.0-alpha05
- https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/camera#1.3.0-rc01

We currently use version 1.3.4 in the plugin, so this would not require a bump to the CameraX version that the plugin depends on.

FYI this is splitting off from https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/149947, which has some more context.
