      "<details>\n",
      "<summary>Reasons for that PR</summary>\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Dependencies:** `two_dimensional_scrollables` is a package on pub.dev and not directly part of Flutter. I think new Flutter devs will expect the `Table` widget to support that out of the box, without needing to search for an extra package. As seen in #21594, a few hundred people gave a thumbs up to that feature, so it seems like expected behavior should be internal. Also, when we compare it to other popular frameworks like MAUI, Ionic, or NativeScript, that kind of functionality is built-in without any extra dependencies.\n",
      "2. **Complexity:** I think for simple tables, most devs will expect a structure like `Table > TableRow > TableCell`, since that’s exactly how it works in HTML. In contrast, `TableView` works differently, the `rowBuilder` is separated from the cells, which could makes the widget tree harder to understand. Also, in `TableViewCell`, you have to set both `columnMergeSpan` and `columnMergeStart`. That makes sense when using the builder, but for a simple table, it feels a bit off or unnecessarily complicated. In most other frameworks, and even in standard HTML tables, you just set `colSpan` and `rowSpan` without needing to define a start position.\n",
      "3. **Built-in RTL:** I'm not 100% sure, but it seems that `TableView.builder` doesn't handle RTL correctly, or at least in my example, switching to RTL still keeps cell 0,0 on the top-left. Btw the existing `Table` widget already supports RTL, and the PR just extends that to also respect it for cell spanning.\n",
      "4. **TableCellVerticalAlignment**: Also, not 100% sure, but it seems like `verticalAlignment` isn’t supported in `TableView`. In this PR, `verticalAlignment` still works as expected and it also works correctly with `colSpan` and `rowSpan` for each individual cell.\n",
      "5. **Performance:** That's a good point you mentioned. For large tables with many offscreen cells that can be lazy-loaded, `TableView.builder` will definitely perform better. But for small tables where all cells are visible, I’m pretty sure it’s faster than `TableView`, though I doubt users would notice any difference. Comparing the original `Table` code to my changes, there’s a minimal impact on performance, but I don’t think that’s something end users would feel, especially since the `Table` widget isn’t designed for massive cell counts anyway. I tested it with 10k cells, and it was about 16ms slower, details are in the “Compare-Performance” section below. FYI: if performance is your top priority and readability is less important, I could also rewrite [_computeSpanInformation](https://github.com/hm21/flutter/blob/d11f8a4affe098b5d46bd94c0864c93b7ce84e8a/packages/flutter/lib/src/rendering/table.dart#L1247-L1331) to run directly within the same loop in [performLayout](https://github.com/hm21/flutter/blob/d11f8a4affe098b5d46bd94c0864c93b7ce84e8a/packages/flutter/lib/src/rendering/table.dart#L1633).

However, I still think there are a few reasons why it makes sense to implement it the way it's done in the PR. <details> <summary>Reasons for that PR</summary> 1. **Dependencies:** `two_dimensional_scrollables` is a package on pub.dev and not directly part of Flutter. I think new Flutter devs will expect the `Table` widget to support that out of the box, without needing to search for an extra package. As seen in #21594, a few hundred people gave a thumbs up to that feature, so it seems like expected behavior should be internal. Also, when we compare it to other popular frameworks like MAUI, Ionic, or NativeScript, that kind of functionality is built-in without any extra dependencies. 2. **Complexity:** I think for simple tables, most devs will expect a structure like `Table > TableRow > TableCell`, since that’s exactly how it works in HTML. In contrast, `TableView` works differently, the `rowBuilder` is separated from the cells, which could makes the widget tree harder to understand. Also, in `TableViewCell`, you have to set both `columnMergeSpan` and `columnMergeStart`. That makes sense when using the builder, but for a simple table, it feels a bit off or unnecessarily complicated. In most other frameworks, and even in standard HTML tables, you just set `colSpan` and `rowSpan` without needing to define a start position. 3. **Built-in RTL:** I'm not 100% sure, but it seems that `TableView.builder` doesn't handle RTL correctly, or at least in my example, switching to RTL still keeps cell 0,0 on the top-left. Btw the existing `Table` widget already supports RTL, and the PR just extends that to also respect it for cell spanning. 4. **TableCellVerticalAlignment**: Also, not 100% sure, but it seems like `verticalAlignment` isn’t supported in `TableView`. In this PR, `verticalAlignment` still works as expected and it also works correctly with `colSpan` and `rowSpan` for each individual cell. 5. **Performance:** That's a good point you mentioned. For large tables with many offscreen cells that can be lazy-loaded, `TableView.builder` will definitely perform better. But for small tables where all cells are visible, I’m pretty sure it’s faster than `TableView`, though I doubt users would notice any difference. Comparing the original `Table` code to my changes, there’s a minimal impact on performance, but I don’t think that’s something end users would feel, especially since the `Table` widget isn’t designed for massive cell counts anyway. I tested it with 10k cells, and it was about 16ms slower, details are in the “Compare-Performance” section below. FYI: if performance is your top priority and readability is less important, I could also rewrite [_computeSpanInformation](https://github.com/hm21/flutter/blob/d11f8a4affe098b5d46bd94c0864c93b7ce84e8a/packages/flutter/lib/src/rendering/table.dart#L1247-L1331) to run directly within the same loop in [performLayout](https://github.com/hm21/flutter/blob/d11f8a4affe098b5d46bd94c0864c93b7ce84e8a/packages/flutter/lib/src/rendering/table.dart#L1633).

Anyway, if the points I mentioned aren’t relevant for you and the way to go for devs is to use packages for this kind of core functionality, just let me know, then we can close the PR 😉 But in that case, I’d also suggest closing #21594 and mentioning that the recommended solution is to use the `two_dimensional_scrollables` package.

I tested it with 10k cells, and it was about 16ms slower, details are in the “Compare-Performance” section below. FYI: if performance is your top priority and readability is less important, I could also rewrite [_computeSpanInformation](https://github.com/hm21/flutter/blob/d11f8a4affe098b5d46bd94c0864c93b7ce84e8a/packages/flutter/lib/src/rendering/table.dart#L1247-L1331) to run directly within the same loop in [performLayout](https://github.com/hm21/flutter/blob/d11f8a4affe098b5d46bd94c0864c93b7ce84e8a/packages/flutter/lib/src/rendering/table.dart#L1633). And also the loop inside [table_border.dart](https://github.com/hm21/flutter/blob/d11f8a4affe098b5d46bd94c0864c93b7ce84e8a/packages/flutter/lib/src/rendering/table_border.dart#L288-L398) could I merge. </details> <br/> <details> <summary>Compare-Performance</summary> To measure the average render duration, I repeatedly called `setState()` 100 times. #### **Test 1: Very Large (10,000 cells: 500 rows × 20 columns)** | Version | Avg (ms) | Min (ms) | Max (ms) | |--------------|-----------|-----------|-----------| | **Original** | 351.09 | 275.40 | 469.32 | | **PR** | 367.22 | 289.07 | 452.91 | --- #### **Test 2: Large (500 cells: 50 rows × 10 columns)** | Version | Avg (ms) | Min (ms) | Max (ms) | |--------------|-----------|-----------|-----------| | **Original** | 42.18 | 20.29 | 96.12 | | **PR** | 49.89 | 21.50 | 80.72 | </details> Btw, I hope you didn’t get me wrong `TableView` from `two_dimensional_scrollables` is definitely an awesome package, and I saw in the commits that you’re also working on it. Still, as I mentioned above, I believe there are valid reasons why it could make sense to support `colSpan`/`rowSpan` in the default `Table` as well. Anyway, if the points I mentioned aren’t relevant for you and the way to go for devs is to use packages for this kind of core functionality, just let me know, then we can close the PR 😉 But in that case, I’d also suggest closing #21594 and mentioning that the recommended solution is to use the `two_dimensional_scrollables` package. Thanks again for the fast response to that PR and I'll fill out the document you mentioned as soon as possible.\n",
